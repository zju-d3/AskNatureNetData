# AskNatureNet Data

## Overview

This repository contains the backend data for AskNatureNet, a divergent thinking tool based on bio-inspired design knowledge. The data is organized in a JSON format, extracted from the comprehensive database available at [AskNatureNet.com](http://www.asknaturenet.com/).

## Data Description

The JSON data file represents a collection of entries with the following structure:

- `Source`: refers to the specific part, organism, or process in nature that directly influences the observed function or feature used in bio-inspired design. It is the specific biological structure or process responsible for the function, or the overall organism or natural system it is part of;
- `Function1` to `Function6`: refer to the functional advantages, characteristics, or capabilities that biological systems demonstrate in solving specific problems or performing specific tasks within their environments. These functions are directly observable and are identified for their relevance in addressing analogous challenges in human-designed solutions; Not all entries will have all six functions populated.
- `Application`: describes how the biological functions can be translated into the innovation or design solution.
- `Biological Strategy`: The biological strategy of the BID case.
- `Hyperlink`: A link to the original website of the BID case in AskNature.

## How to Use

The data can be used for research, educational purposes, and to fuel innovation in bio-inspired design. To use the data, simply download the JSON file and integrate it into your project as needed.
