To mitigate against the damage caused by freeze-thaw cycles, engineers add air-entraining admixtures, which add microscopic bubbles to the mixture to help prevent freezing.

The PowerCone attaches directly to the hub of a wind turbine and co-rotates with the rotor, helping it to capture more of the wind that’s already blowing. It redistributes wind to enhance the performance of existing turbines, lowering cut-in speeds, increasing torque and ultimately making the turbine more effective and efficient. It does this because the PowerCone mimics the coning angle of the maple seed. The coning angle is the angle at which a maple seed falls as it moves through the air, following the path of least resistance. The PowerCone also mimics a kingfisher beak, which allows the bird to dive into the water while barely making a splash.

Additionally, these wings cannot be rapidly deployed, making them unusable in certain high intensity situations.\n\nInnovation details\nThe robot was inspired by the wings of the ladybird beetle. It has a compact and lightweight wing system that is self-deployable due to a single curved joint, similar to how a tape measure is able to keep its shape. This joint stores elastic energy until released to sustain flight. The lightweight design allows the robot to travel farther, but is still sturdy enough not to buckle under large aerodynamic forces.\n\nBiological Model\nLadybird beetles have deployable wings that are carefully folded beneath a stiff outer barrier. The shape of the wing joints allow the wings to rapidly spring free when needed, usually within 0.1 seconds. The wings are also very resilient and sturdy, preventing them from folding or buckling when flapping at a high frequency. The secret to these wings is a unique tape-spring-shaped vein. When a ladybird beetle folds its wings, the vein deforms, allowing elastic energy to be stored inside it. This stored energy allows the wings to be quickly and easily deployed, and also allows it to lock in place without the need for additional components."}, {"Source": "lobster shell", "Application": "3d printed concrete", "Function1": "strong", "Function2": "flexible", "Function3": "resistance to cracking", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/innovation/durable-3d-printed-concrete-inspired-by-lobster-shells/", "Strategy": "Durable 3D Printed Concrete Inspired by Lobster Shells\n3D printed concrete from RMIT University is constructed with helicoid layers to increase strength.\n\nThe Challenge\n3D printed concrete has the potential to make building structures more efficient and sustainable by saving time, money, and materials.

The algorithm contains synthetic, mathematical “T-cells” that simultaneously monitor several variables from health systems across the country: number of clinic visits, intake temperatures, days of the year when abnormalities appear, etc. It then processes the collected information using a negative selection process in which it identifies atypical trends. This negative selection process and the synthetic “T-cells” result in more nuanced data collection, and early trials of the biosurveillance system have demonstrated its ability to separate trends from typical seasonal influenzas.\n\nBiological Model\nOur immune systems are composed of billions of white blood cells constantly on the lookout for illnesses and foreign invaders, ready to respond if the body is under attack. T-cells, also known as T-lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell and a vital component of the immune system. T-cells learn which cells to attack through a negative selection “training” process, in which T-cells that attack intruders are kept alive and T-cells that attack normal body cells are destroyed.

Cutting down on carbon emissions from cement will involve investing in green cement technology and finding ways to build more efficiently with concrete. One major flaw with concrete as a construction material is its poor flexural strength, or lack of elasticity.

These low-cost, portable toilets use a simple membrane to rapidly evaporate 95% of sewage without using any type of energy. This provides homes with a working toilet, without the need for power or plumbing. The compact, contained, stand alone units can be dropped into any space quickly, and the ‘self-flushing’ technology works while being completely waterless and environmentally safe.

Hyperspectral imaging allows computer software to divide visible wavelengths of light into different, more narrow bands. Polarimetry is the measurement of polarization in light, which can be used to determine the surface geometry (such as rough or smooth) of an object in an image. Phone cameras and digital cameras work well for capturing a photo with many colors and dimensions, but do not accurately capture all the different wavelengths of light. To capture this additional information, bulky components need to be added, making the camera less portable.\n\nInnovation details\nThe researchers mimicked the eyes of the mantis shrimp to create a new optical sensor called SIMPOL (Stomatopod Inspired Multispectral and POLarization). Mantis shrimp eyes are some of the most astounding in the animal kingdom, with 16 photoreceptors that can distinguish between several different types of light, including UV and polarized light. SIMPOL uses a combination of hyperspectral and polarimetric imaging to measure four color channels and three polarization channels at one point. To do this it uses stacking polarization-sensitive organic photovoltaics (P-OPVs) and polymer retarders. The P-OPVs have an anisotropic (multidirectional) response and the retarders’ disperse the light signals. Altogether the optical sensor is ten times more precise than a typical sensor.\n\nBiological Model\nThe eyes of the mantis shrimp contain 16 photoreceptors (compared to four in humans) that are able to detect several different types of light, including UV and polarized light, simultaneously.

They can feel ever-so-slight movements in the water and follow a trail left behind in the wake of swimming fish. Their homing device is their whiskers, whose quirky structure makes them ideally suited to work in water.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nBut whiskers stick out of animals to sense their surrounding environment. They transmit signals to a rich network of nerve cells at the whiskers’ base that make them as sensitive as fingertips. Cat whiskers have some 200 nerve endings. Harbor seal whiskers, with up to 1,500, are even more finely tuned. But the real secret to their success is their structure.\n\nIf you’ve ever seen old-fashioned antennas on cars or flags on bicycles, you’ll notice how they sway and flutter when the vehicles move. Air currents swirl around them, causing them to vibrate. (The scientific name of whiskers is “vibrissae,” which comes from the Latin word for “vibrate.”)\n\nYou’d expect seal whiskers to behave similarly when seals swim through water. But instead, something remarkable happens: The whiskers cut through water like a hot knife through butter, barely wiggling in the waves.\n\nThe key is their shape. Seal whiskers aren’t circular in cross-section, but oval-shaped. And their leading edges aren’t straight, but have a wavy, in-and-out pattern. This structural design neutralizes the swirling action of water around the whiskers, so that the whiskers don’t vibrate when the seals move.\n\nInstead, they remain still and ready to respond to disturbances generated by other swimmers. The whiskers vibrate up and down, over and under oncoming swirls the way a skier slaloms back and forth down a slope of oncoming obstacles.\n\nBigger fish produce larger swirls, and faster fish leave more of them in their wakes. By feeling these swirls with their whiskers, seals can precisely identify the size, speed, and direction of potential targets and follow their downstream trail, in one test 30 seconds after a target had passed by.\n"}, {"Source": "kombucha", "Application": "eco-friendly, biocompatible materials", "Function1": "yeast fermentation", "Function2": "mutual survival of microorganisms", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/kombucha-a-microbial-metropolis/", "Strategy": "Kombucha: A Microbial Metropolis\n\nBacteria and yeast form a community to ensure their mutual survival and produce fermented tea.\nIntroduction \n\nKombucha is a slightly bubbly, sweet-and-sour, fermented tea drink that is reputed (though clinically unproven) to be healthful. It originated in East Asia more than 2,000 years ago, but in recent decades has become popular in the West.\n\nBut on another level, kombucha is something else entirely. It’s a marvelous multicultural microscopic metropolis.\n\nKombucha is made by (and continues to contain) a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast often abbreviated as “SCOBY.” These microorganisms cooperate and compete in a microbial marketplace—manufacturing and trading essential products and building infrastructure to create flourishing homes, warehouses to store resources, and defenses against invaders.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nTo make a new batch of kombucha (much like making sourdough), people put a sample of existing kombucha into sweetened tea, giving the microorganisms a new supply of sugar to feed on.\n\nFirst, the yeast, which are a type of fungi, use the sugars and nutrients in the tea to grow. In this process, called fermentation, they turn carbon into carbon dioxide gas, creating the fizz, and produce alcohol as a byproduct, which usually creates the buzz in other fermented drinks.\n\nToo much alcohol can be harmful to bacteria and yeast, but the bacteria in kombucha get rid of it. They use alcohol to grow, converting it into acids, such as acetic acid (vinegar), which gives kombucha its sour taste. The acids in turn inhibit the growth of competing bacteria that could be harmful to both the SCOBY and the kombucha drinkers.\n\nTo deter invaders further, the bacteria also use excess sugars to make long, thin fibers of cellulose—the same substance that plants and trees use as structural material. The fibers rise to the top of the brew, depositing layers that glom into a big multilayered biofilm called a pellicle. The pellicle is the characteristic rubbery-looking layer on top of brewing kombucha. It’s often simply referred to as “SCOBY” itself because it contains enough microorganisms to serve as a starter for new batches of kombucha (hence its other name, “mother”). The pellicle acts as a protective shield that blocks out competitors and keeps the microbial community from drying out. It may even offer protection from harmful ultraviolet rays.\n\nEmbedded in this floating biofilm, the bacteria can maintain access to oxygen near the top of the brew that they need to do their metabolic business. The cellulose also serves as a storehouse of material that the bacteria and yeast can convert back to sugar when needed. When yeast die, they in turn release vitamins and nutrients that are recycled by the microbial community.\n\nAll in all, the various microorganisms in kombucha coexist and cooperate to create a cycle of nutrients and a physical structure that ensure their mutual survival.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThough the general recipe for kombucha is well known, each brew comes from an individual “mother.” Each is a unique SCOBY with a singular combination of various species of yeasts and bacteria (and perhaps even viruses)—many of whose identities and activities remain unknown. SCOBYs can interact in different ways to produce different outcomes.\n\nScientists are exploring the inner workings of different SCOBYs to learn the intricacies of how they operate to see if they can manipulate them to create other useful products. These might include kombucha drinks that have more healthful properties or different tastes. Similar research could enhance other fermented foods made with SCOBYs, such as sourdough, kefir, and cheeses.\n\nOther exciting targets for research are SCOBY-generated biofilms. Their fibers are much thinner than those made by plants, but they are strong and hold much more water. SCOBY biofilms are being tested to make new eco-friendly, biocompatible materials for wound dressings, sustainable living water-filtration systems, cosmetics, paper, and textiles for clothing.\n\nOn a more abstract level, those single-celled critters could offer us multicellular humans a few lessons on balancing conflict and cooperation within communities."}, {"Source": "rainbow's body", "Application": "cyclists' stratgy", "Function1": "utilize water vortices", "Function2": "extract energy", "Function3": "produce a upstream force", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/body-uses-vortices-to-save-energy/", "Strategy": "Body Uses Vortices to Save Energy\n\nThe body of rainbow trout decreases energy required for swimming by interacting with vortices in its fluid environment.\n\nMany fish swim using an undulating motion of their bodies. The muscle activity that bends the body and produces these movements during steady, continuous swimming can cost a significant amount of energy. But some fishes, such as rainbow trout, can adopt a special swimming behavior that likely enables them to save their own energy by extracting energy from nearby water vortices.\n\nIn a fluid environment, vortices are swirls of water or air often released (or “shed”) from stationary objects and other living creatures, including other fish, that are in the path of an oncoming flow. Trout use water vortices that come their way from upstream sources to their advantage by adjusting their typical swimming behavior to produce a ‘slalom’ movement between vortices. Body bends increase in amplitude and curvature, and the tail beats at a frequency that matches the frequency at which vortices are shed upstream. The pattern of muscle activity along the body also changes, where only muscles close to the head are active. This differs from typical undulating motion where muscles contract all along the body, starting from the head and moving toward the tail to produce a traveling body wave that pushes the fish forward. Researchers hypothesize that these changes in muscle activity and body motion help the trout position its body so that it interacts with the vortices in a specific way. The exact nature of this interaction is still under investigation, but one explanation is that the fish controls the angle of its body so that local flow from the vortices produces a continuous upstream force on the body. Scientist James Liao uses the analogy, “…we hypothesize that trout use their body like a sail to tack upstream.”\n\nThe general concept of taking advantage of altered fluid flows behind other objects to reduce the energetic cost of motion is found in human behaviors too, for instance, in cyclists that draft behind one another to save energy.\nCheck out these videos to see the trout’s slalom movement in action.\n\n"}, {"Source": "desert beetle's back", "Application": "reduce engineered surfaces' frost", "Function1": "form water condense", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/surface-shape-controls-ice/", "Strategy": "Surface Shape Controls Ice\n\nMacro-scale geometry directs where water condenses and frost forms.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWater moves between organisms and their environment in a constant, creative dance, the underlying principles of which many humans have striven to understand. For instance, if you pay close attention on a cold morning, you’ll notice that frost appears in certain specific locations on leaves, but not other spots. Corners, edges, and bumps on leaves and other surfaces tend to gather more ice crystals, while flatter or more concave surfaces remain clear. Why do we see this kind of pattern?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nFrost forms when water vapor in humid air makes contact with a surface that is below freezing temperature. Every location on a smooth surface is equally suitable for becoming the site of a water droplet. However, the volume of air (and water vapor) around things that “stick out” is greater than the volume of air around embedded, concave surfaces that “stick in”. So there are simply more chances for a quantity of water vapor to condense at these locations. Moreover, as frost appears preferentially on convex features, individual ice crystals attract more ice formation and grow.\n\nSimilar principles are at work with water in liquid form condensing on the relatively large bumps on the back of the Namib Desert Beetle (Onymacris unguicularis). Condensation is more likely to happen on these more exposed, convex features that stick out into the air volume than elsewhere, while evaporation tends to remove what little water has condensed on concave features.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe formation of ice can range from being inconvenient to being dangerous. A better understanding of how and where water condenses and ice forms has given scientists and designers a new set of ways to manipulate engineered surfaces to reduce frost formation.

Very likely, a honeybee was involved in a vital way.\n\nHoneybees (Apis mellifera) are important pollinators for wild plants and human agricultural systems, crucial to the pollination of foods including apples, cherries, blueberries, broccoli, pumpkins, and almonds. Honeybee populations have been declining, however, because of a number of threats, including bacterial and fungal diseases and parasitic mites. Many insecticides cannot be used to control these threats though, because they also kill the bees.\n\nHoneybees have important chemical abilities that can help them deal with some of these threats, however. For example, the insecticide tau-fuvalinate, a derivative from pyrethrum daisies, successfully controls parasitic varroa mites without harming the bees themselves. That’s because bees have enzymes––special protein molecules capable of making changes to other molecules––which can detoxify certain insecticides.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe enzymes known as P450s (short for cytochrome P450 monooxygenases) appear to be especially effective at detoxifying the insecticide tau-fuvalinate. Researchers draw this kind of conclusion from studies in which chemicals known to inhibit P450 enzymes (e.g., piperonyl butoxide, or PBO) are added to sugar water and fed to bees, and the toxic effects of insecticides like tau-fuvalinate––such as a lack of coordination––become more apparent. Remove the PBO enzyme inhibitor, and the bees are no longer impacted as strongly by tau-fulvalinate.\n\nHow does it work? P450 enzymes are known to be capable of stripping electrons away from (i.e., oxidizing) molecular structures known as aromatic rings, found in natural toxins as well as pyrethrum-derived insecticides.\nA similar process occurs when you cut an apple and it begins to brown: oxygen in the air removes electrons from now-exposed molecules in the apple’s flesh, and you can see the apple’s molecules undergo change. The formation of rust from metal in moist air is another similar oxidation-degradation process.\n\nAromatic rings are molecules, or parts of molecules, that form circular chains of carbon atoms with various side groups. When these structures are stripped of electrons, they become unstable and begin to break down. Tau-fulvalinate contains an additional aromatic ring, which may explain why honeybees, with their P450 enzymes, are especially able to detoxify it.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe abilities of enzymes to change and detoxify otherwise harmful chemicals is of great use not only to honeybees, but more widely for people in our efforts to cope with both human-made and natural toxins. The natural metabolic adaptations of other species can suggest enzymatic compounds and chemical processes which can help us neutralize toxins in our own environment. P450 enzymes similar to those found in honeybees, for example, are now used to break down a variety of chemicals harmful to people and other species alike, including carcinogens, steroids, and pesticides."}, {"Source": "spider's silk", "Application": "particular specifications' fibers", "Function1": "produce fiber", "Function2": "turn liquid into fiber", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/salt-and-squeezing-turn-liquid-to-spider-silk/", "Strategy": "Salt and Squeezing Turn Liquid to Spider Silk\n\nSpiders turn liquid into a strong, stretchy fiber by squeezing it through a small space that helps protein molecules to connect with each other.\nIntroduction \n\nPerched on a dewy leaf on a warm summer’s dawn, an orb-weaving spider begins her work for the day. Pushing proteins from her body, she produces a fine fiber that sticks to the surface of the leaf. Clambering from leaf to leaf, the spider creates a web she will use to trap insects to eat.\n\nSmall and often out of sight, spiders may seem little more than a decorative footnote to nature. In reality, they’re some of nature’s most remarkable engineers. To create the webs they use to trap meals, they turn a liquid into a fiber that’s far thinner than a human hair and five times stronger than steel. Most surprisingly,  these fibers are produced instantaneously, from the spiders’ own bodies, using only raw materials they get from the insects and other prey they catch.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nAt first glance, spinning spider silk thread may not seem a remarkable feat. Microscopy and chemistry have enabled humans to look closer though, and see it for the natural wonder that it is. For one thing, spiders store the proteins that make up the fiber in liquid form inside their bodies, preventing them from hardening into a fiber there. Second, the fiber itself takes on a variety of traits, with variations in thickness, stickiness, stretchiness, and other characteristics depending on how the fiber is “pultruded,” or pulled from a spider’s body as the spider moves away from an end that’s stuck to a surface.\n\nHow do spiders do it? It all has to do with the design of the silk’s protein molecules, the solutions they’re stored in, and the way they’re molded as they pass through a spider’s silk ducts.\n\nWhile silk proteins vary between spider species, they all appear to share a particularly important region called a “salt bridge.” Salt bridges are pairs of protein regions that are oppositely charged and therefore attracted to one another. Salt bridges help to stabilize the proteins and keep them folded. At lower pH levels, the salt bridge becomes unstable, and the protein structure can start to unfold.\n\nWhen the liquid silk is pulled from inside the spider, it goes through the spinning duct, which is a narrow tunnel. Large, folded proteins can’t fit through, so they must be unfolded. As the protein moves through the duct, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase helps to create a pH gradient that is slowly lowered from about 8 to about 5.7 (becoming more acidic). It does this by catalyzing the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into carbonic acid, and vice versa. This reduction in pH causes the salt bridges to come apart. This allows the protein to start unfolding into a more linear configuration that can more easily move through the spinning duct.\n\nThe narrow duct also creates shear forces that physically force the unfolded protein molecules into elongated shapes that can more easily line up in parallel to one another. This is an essential part of the spinning process, as it allows the viscous, protein-filled solution to flow more easily through the spinning duct, reducing the energy requirements for spinning. Some sections of the silk connect many times over with bonds forming between them like rungs between two sides of a ladder (a structure called a “beta sheet”). Other sections only connect end-to-end. The resulting structure is then both very strong and very stretchy, giving the finished silk its famous properties, perfect for capturing dinner.\n\nThe Potential \n\nPotential applications of a spider’s ability to turn a liquid into a durable fiber are all but endless. Most directly, the process could be applied to make thread that can be woven into fabrics for clothing, household goods, and more without the need for high temperatures, harsh chemicals, or other environmentally unfriendly inputs or byproducts.\n\nBecause so many details of the pultrusion process—speed, chemical environment, and more—affect the characteristics of the final product, spider silk production can be also applied to making fibers that conform to very particular specifications necessary for technical uses, such as water filtration. The ability to make a strong fiber that can be readily molded into specific shapes might be applied to making scaffolds for artificial organs.\n\nFinally, the overall process of fiber-making might be programmed into robots, enabling them to use environmental conditions to guide the production of variable fibers with minimal input from humans."}, {"Source": "hagfish's skin cell", "Application": "developing innovative filtration technologies", "Function1": "selective absorption", "Function2": "absorb through skin", "Function3": "deny non-vital compounds", "Function4": "selective transport", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/semi-permeable-skin-selectively-absorbs-organic-nutrients/", "Strategy": "Semi‑permeable Skin Selectively\nAbsorbs Organic Nutrients\n\nSkin cells of hagfish are capable of directly absorbing organic nutrients using specially adapted transport channels and leveraging sodium ion gradients.\n\nIntroduction \n\nAbsorbing nutrients from the environment is essential for all heterotrophic organisms. All but a few vertebrates accomplish this task orally by consuming food and absorbing freed nutrients through the gut epithelium. Nutrient uptake through the skin is not observed in most vertebrates because skin, by its nature, is meant to function as a tough, mostly impermeable barrier.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nHowever, Pacific hagfish have adapted to suit their feeding habitat by evolving the ability to absorb certain organic nutrients directly through their skin. Hagfish feed by burrowing through the decaying corpses of large animals, a rich stew of organic nutrients that have sunk to the ocean floor. In this environment, absorption of some nutrients through direct skin contact is a valuable adaptation. But skin must also be a strong physical barrier and capable of denying passage of non-vital compounds.\n\nHagfish feed by burrowing through the decaying corpses of large animals, a rich stew of organic nutrients that have sunk to the ocean floor.\n\nThe hagfish solves this conflict by embedding active transport proteins in its skin epithelium cells. The transport channels are highly selective for specific nutrient substrates like amino acids. They derive the energy required for transport from a sodium ion gradient that exists between the outside of the skin cells and the inside. Like almost all cells, hagfish cells actively pump sodium ions out of their cytoplasm. This creates a concentration gradient across the cell membrane. Allowing sodium ions to flow back into the cell through the transport channels fuels the energy-intensive uptake of useful nutrients, which is called symport.\n\nOther factors like allosteric regulation can manipulate how compounds are absorbed through the skin. In this way, the hagfish permit the transport of select nutrients through an otherwise impermeable skin barrier.\n\nThe Potential \n\nIn the case of hagfish, their skin functions as a highly selective semi-permeable membrane. Learning how its proteins facilitate passage of some compounds while inhibiting others could aid in developing innovative filtration technologies. These technologies could help clean our water, improve medical treatments like kidney dialysis, and help deliver targeted medical therapies to specific tissues in the body."}, {"Source": "oregano", "Application": "food preservation", "Function1": "prevent fungal infection", "Function2": "prevent food spoilage", "Function3": "initiate plants’ natural defense responses", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/chemicals-in-oregano-act-as-fungicide/", "Strategy": "Chemicals in Oregano Act as Fungicide\n\nVolatile compounds found in oregano destroy fungi by breaking down their cell membranes."}, {"Source": "rosette succulent's leaf", "Application": "storing water;controlling humidity", "Function1": "collect water", "Function2": "smooth surface", "Function3": "high surface area", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-capture-water-from-fog/", "Strategy": "Leaves Capture Water From Fog\n\nThe leaves of rosette succulents intercept water droplets from fog through their waxy, smooth surface.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDespite the relatively harsh conditions of North America’s deserts, a wide range of plants taking many shapes and forms have been able to thrive in these areas. Rosette succulents make up a diverse group of plants that have successfully established in desert ecosystems, especially at the elevations at which clouds form.\n\nMany of them have relatively large leaves that store large volumes of water and are arranged in layers spreading out from around the base of the plant. This structure helps them to collect and store water from rain and fog, and is one of the keys to their success in these environments.\"\n\nThe Strategy\n\nConsidering their evolutionary history, fog is a relatively new source of water for these plants. Nonetheless, rosette succulents have developed several characteristics to help them make use of this resource.\n\nAgaves, for example, are highly efficient at harvesting water––even from fog and the lightest of rainfalls––thanks to the smooth surface of their leaves created by a waxy outer layer that also serves as a barrier to water loss. The water droplets in fog have a lot of surface area with which to make contact with other surfaces. With this high surface area, and being relatively lightweight, fog droplets are captured by an envelope of slow-moving air that surrounds a leaf and directed along its smooth surface. Species in cloud belts also tend to use that effect, as well as an arrangement of leaves that act like a funnel, to transport harvested water to their roots.\n\nIn higher altitude areas where fog is common, many rosette succulents have evolved to exhibit the “narrow-leaf syndrome.” This is a specific set of traits that can help increase a plant’s efficiency in capturing moisture from fog. Narrow and flexible leaves are better able to catch water droplets and direct their movement to the base, while a longer basal stem helps the plant catch more fog by holding it higher above the ground.\n\nThe Potential Rosette succulents can serve as inspiration for ways we can harvest and store water from alternative, temporary sources like fog, for drinking and other uses.\n\nTheir strategy for removing moisture from the air can also be applied to enclosed spaces in which humidity control is necessary for maintaining livable conditions for people, plants, or animals. Some spaces that could benefit from this technology include indoor swimming pools, ice rinks, and stadiums, as well as large-scale enclosed habitats on land, in the sea, or beyond."}, {"Source": "mushroom anemone's protein", "Application": "colorful and environmentally friendly textiles", "Function1": "produce color", "Function2": "generate specific wavelengths of light", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/protein-turns-sunlight-into-vivid-color/", "Strategy": "Protein Turns Sunlight Into Vivid Color\n\nProteins made by Discosoma mushroom anemones produce color by using the sun’s energy to generate specific wavelengths of light. \n\nIntroduction \n\nTurn plain sunlight into vibrant color? These pancake-shaped coral relatives found in the Indian and Pacific oceans are on it. Members of the Discosoma genus, they have spots around their mouths that glow yellow-orange to bright red, depending on the species, after being exposed to light.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nBehind this ability are extremely long molecules known as fluorescent proteins that are folded into a shape that looks a little like a plate of spaghetti, with two tubelike sections, called beta barrels, sitting on top of it. Inside each of the beta barrels is a special stretch of protein called a chromophore. The chromophore’s unique configuration allows it to absorb a photon—a packet of energy—from the sun and use that energy to produce a pulse of red light. The beta barrels shield the chromophore from other molecules that could steal the energy before the chromophore can use it to create the fluorescent protein’s signature glow.\n\nThere are many very similar molecules that corals (and other marine creatures) produce, in colors that include red, cyan, green-yellow, and purple-blue. No one knows for sure, but scientists have speculated that the proteins might protect the corals from sunburn. They might help the corals contribute to a partnership with algae that capture light energy and share it with the coral. They might signal something about the coral to other animals. They also might help the corals deal with stress by destroying molecules that could harm them.\n\nThe Potential \n\nDiscosoma’s glowing reputation holds potential benefit for humans as well. Many conventional fabric dyes are toxic or cause cancer or mutations. They can pollute the environment, reducing water quality in lakes and streams and harming plants and beneficial microbes in the soil. In contrast, fluorescent proteins can biodegrade into simple molecules such as carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen found in all living things.\n\nIf manufacturers could incorporate these molecules into the molecules that make fibers, they could use those fibers to make textiles that are colorful without requiring harmful dyes. The colorful proteins could be designed to readily degrade when their useful life is over into friendly molecules.\nAs our ability to synthesize proteins and incorporate them into other molecules has advanced, it is now possible to use Discosoma’s design as a basis for producing environmentally friendly textiles with a range of built-in colors."}, {"Source": "bird's bone", "Application": "airframes", "Function1": "increasing density", "Function2": "maximize stiffness and strength", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bones-maximize-stiffness-and-strength/", "Strategy": "Bones Maximize Stiffness and Strength\n\nThe bones of birds maximize stiffness and strength relative to weight by increasing density.\n“The skeletons of birds are universally described as lightweight as a result of selection for minimizing the energy required for flight. From a functional perspective, the weight (mass) of an animal relative to its lift-generating surfaces is a key determinant of the metabolic cost of flight. The evolution of birds has been characterized by many weight-saving adaptations that are reflected in bone shape, many of which strengthen and stiffen the skeleton. Although largely unstudied in birds, the material properties of bone tissue can also contribute to bone strength and stiffness. In this study, I calculated the density of the cranium, humerus and femur in passerine birds, rodents and bats by measuring bone mass and volume using helium displacement. I found that, on average, these bones are densest in birds, followed closely by bats. As bone density increases, so do bone stiffness and strength. Both of these optimization criteria are used in the design of strong and stiff, but lightweight, manmade airframes.

The evolution of animals and life as we now know it owe everything to photosynthesis.\n\nAbout 2.5 billion years ago, cyanobacteria—the first organisms that used sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and sugars via photosynthesis—transformed our atmosphere. Later, algae evolved with this ability, and about 0.5 billion years ago, the first land plants sprouted.\n\nAlgae, plankton, and land plants now work together to keep our atmosphere full of oxygen.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nPhotosynthesis occurs in special plant cells called chloroplasts, which are the type of cells found in leaves. A single chloroplast is like a bag filled with the main ingredients needed for photosynthesis. It has water soaked up from the plant’s roots, atmospheric carbon dioxide absorbed by the leaves, and chlorophyll contained in folded, maze-like organelles called thylakoids.\n\nChlorophyll is the true catalyst of photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria, plankton, and land plants all rely on this light-sensitive molecule to spark the process.\n\nChlorophyll molecules are so bad at absorbing green light that they reflect it like tiny mirrors, causing our eyes to see most leaves as green. It’s usually only in autumn, after chlorophyll degrades, that we peep those infinite shades of yellow and orange produced by carotenoid pigments.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nBut chlorophyll’s superpower isn’t the ability to reflect green light—it’s the ability to absorb blue and red light like a sponge. The sun’s blue and red light energizes chlorophyll, causing it to lose electrons, which become mobile forms of chemical energy that power plant growth. The chlorophyll replenishes its lost electrons not by drinking water but by splitting it apart and taking electrons from the hydrogen, leaving oxygen as a byproduct to be “exhaled”.\n\nThe electrons freed from chlorophyll are utilized in at least two ways. First, they are used to build up a high concentration of protons in the space inside the thylakoid (called the lumen), which in turn drives the transformation of ADP into ATP—nature’s energy carrier molecule. Secondly, they reduce NADP+ to NADPH. These transformations take place in the stroma, the area outside of the thylakoid folds but still inside the chloroplast “bag.” The energy brought by \nATP and NADPH fuels a series of reactions in which carbon dioxide is persuaded to give up its precious cargo of carbon to build glucose and other key metabolic compounds. As these reactions (known as the Calvin Cycle) occur, the molecules are depleted back to ADP and NADP+ returning to the thylakoid folds to replenish their store of energy through sunlight-stimulated chlorophyll.\n\nWhen plants have enough sunlight, water, and fertile soil, the photosynthesis cycle continues to churn out more and more glucose. Glucose is like food that plants use to build their bodies. They combine thousands of glucose molecules to make cellulose, the main component of their cell walls. The more cellulose they make, the more they grow.\n\nThe Potential \n\nNature, through photosynthesis, enables plants to convert the sun’s energy into a form that they and other living things can make use of. Plants transfer that energy directly to most other living things as food or as food for animals that other animals eat.\n\nHumans also extract this energy indirectly from wood, or from plants that decayed millions of years ago into oil, coal, and natural gas. Burning these materials to provide electricity and heat has, through overexploitation, led to dire consequences that have upset the balance of life on Earth.\n\nWhat if humans could harness this power in a different way? Imagine green chemistry that’s catalyzed by sunlight instead of having to mine for heavy metals like copper, tin, or platinum. Think of the potential that chemical processes requiring little heat have to reduce energy consumption. With a better understanding of photosynthesis, we may transform agriculture to consume less water and preserve more land for native plants and forests. As we continue to grapple with climate change, listening to what plants can teach us can shine a light down a greener path."}, {"Source": "forested peatland", "Application": "artificial carbon sequestration systems", "Function1": "capture carbon dioxide", "Function2": "store carbon dioxide", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/boreal-forested-peatland-captures-and-stores-carbon-dioxide/", "Strategy": "Trees and Peat Capture and Store Carbon\n\nBoreal forested peatland captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it long-term through delayed decomposition of plants.\nIntroduction \n\nPlants are made of air.\n\nAbsorbing carbon dioxide as a gas, they break the invisible molecules apart and knit the atoms together into roots, stems, trunks, and leaves. Some of these structures are fleeting, disintegrating within weeks or months, and sending their carbon right back into the atmosphere. Other structures are built to last, and hold that carbon in place for decades, or even centuries––even after the death of the plant itself.\n\nThis is what gives plant-filled ecosystems like forests and peatlands so much potential for bringing down the level of carbon in the atmosphere. Trees are well known for providing this ecological service, but peat––the thick soil-like accumulation of waterlogged, partially decomposed plants––is the largest natural terrestrial carbon store. In areas where a forest grows on a bed of peat, we get boons from both worlds.\n\nHigh water levels in wetlands prevent large amounts of oxygen from reaching wetland soil, where it would enable aerobic bacteria to decompose organic matter.\n \nThe Strategy \n\nThe forested peatlands of North America’s boreal region can be as dense as other types of forests in these areas. This is significant because the less sunlight there is reaching the forest floor, the longer it takes for plants to decompose. In this way, forested peatlands can protect their peat from decomposing fully and releasing stored carbon back into the atmosphere.\n\nWithin forested peatlands, the peat itself does the heavy lifting, storing much more carbon than the trees. In fact, the forested peatlands of boreal regions in eastern Canada can store as much carbon as other wetlands, like fens and bogs, in the same areas. The combined storage capabilities and protection from decomposition create a self-sufficient system for capturing and storing carbon.\n\nNothing lasts forever though, and fire can cut short the long sleep that carbon would otherwise undergo, locked up in the peat. Whether natural or man-made, fires can result in both forests and peatlands releasing their stored carbon and losing some of their ability to continue storing carbon. Since forested peatlands have such high soil moisture, they are less vulnerable to fires and offer more effective, long-term carbon storage than other forests. Only the drier layers of peat at the surface of the soil are impacted by fires, leaving those deeper layers that are storing carbon unharmed. However, rising global temperatures as a result of climate change are causing drying deeper and deeper into the peat, making these areas increasingly vulnerable to fires.\n\nThe Potential \n\nWhile unforested wetlands generally have greater carbon storage capacity, forested peatlands present a compelling alternate model for a sequestering ecosystem, and are worth protecting for their potential role in reducing the impacts of climate change. As humans seek to develop artificial carbon sequestration systems, the diversity of forested peatlands provides examples and inspiration for how to more effectively pull solutions to climate challenges out of thin air."}, {"Source": "water snail's foot", "Application": "propulsion engine", "Function1": "underwater movement", "Function2": "crawl upside down", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/foot-aids-underwater-movement/", "Strategy": "Foot Aids Underwater Movement\n\nThe foot of water snails helps them move upside down beneath the water's surface by creating small ripples in the mucus-water interface.\n\n“A UC San Diego engineer has revealed a new mode of propulsion based on\nhow water snails create ripples of slime to crawl upside down beneath\nthe surface.\n\n“Eric Lauga, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace\nengineering at the Jacobs School of Engineering, recently published a\npaper…that explains how and why water snails can drag themselves across a\nfluid surface that they can’t even grip.\n\n“Based on Lauga’s research, the secret is in the slime.

Oxygenated air is so ubiquitous in the experience of our everyday life today, that we forget there are still many places where oxygen isn’t so plentiful. In these places––the ocean floor, the nooks and crannies of bedrock, and in your own intestines––descendants of some organisms who first evolved in that early-Earth environment still use oxygen-free methods to perform essential life-supporting chemical processes.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nNearly all organisms on Earth break down sugar (specifically glucose) to create the energy they need to carry out various activities. The energy from breaking down glucose is used to create another molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. ATP is used as a kind of battery, storing energy in cells for use as needed.\nATP isn’t created directly from breaking down glucose. Instead, the breaking of glucose starts a chain reaction, in which a sequence of specific molecules undergo changes that, each in turn, provokes changes in subsequent molecules in a kind of domino tumbling reaction. These changes occur largely as electrons move from one molecule and are incorporated into each subsequent molecule along what is called the “electron transport chain.” Without this flow of electrons through the specific sequence or pathway of molecules, the generation of ATP would grind to a halt. This energy-producing chemical process continues as long as something removes the “spent” electrons at the end of the sequence. In humans and other oxygen-breathing organisms, that something is oxygen. But organisms that live in oxygen-free environments need something different.\nAnaerobic bacteria known as fermenters use a range of pathways for removing spent electrons to keep the process of ATP formation going. For example, in lactic acid fermentation (used for instance in human muscle), a molecule known as NAD+ (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is used as an electron receptor instead of oxygen, allowing the production of lactate, which is further metabolized in the liver. Another pathway using NAD+, known as alcohol fermentation, produces ethanol. Before there was an oxygenated atmosphere, a highly diverse set of chemical pathways evolved for ATP formation––chemical processes that have been retained in the diverse group of fermenting anaerobes that exist today.\n\nThe Potential \n\nPeople have learned to leverage the diverse chemical processes and products used by fermenting microbes to produce a wide variety of other chemical processes and end-products of interest to people. These include things like improving water quality; breaking down plastics; making bread, yogurt, cheese, wine, and miso; and, increasingly, manufacturing non-food items, such as fuel and plastics.\nProduction of industrial materials using microbial fermentation has many advantages. Plastics can be produced without the need to extract or process petroleum, for example. In addition, these plastics can be formulated to be biodegradable. Microbial production of plastics also requires fewer natural resources, such as land, than plastics made directly from plants. Ultimately, the diverse chemical pathways exhibited by fermenting microbes serve as models of possible chemical processes which have greatly broadened humankind’s chemical ideas and methods."}, {"Source": "bacteria's enzyme", "Application": "creating complex molecules", "Function1": "create complex molecule", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/chemicals-made-with-natural-ingredients/", "Strategy": "Chemicals Made With Natural Ingredients\n\nBacteria can use natural chemicals to create complex molecules, including antibiotics, with special enzymes.\n“Until now, only the intricate machinery inside cells could take a mix of enzyme ingredients, blend them together and deliver a natural product with an elaborate chemical structure such as penicillin.

Temperature increases in the ventrum of the abdomen occurred in steps exactly coinciding with the beats of the ventral diaphragm, and with the abdominal ‘ventilatory’ pumping movements when these were present. The ability to prevent overheating of the thorax by transport of heat to the abdomen was abolished when the heart was made inoperative.\n\n“4. At low thoracic temperatures the ventral diaphragm beat at a wide range of rates and with varying interbeat intervals, while the heart beat at a high frequency relative to the ventral diaphragm, but at a very low amplitude. However, when thoracic temperature exceeded 43 °C the amplitudes of both were high, and the interbeat intervals as well as the beating frequencies of the two pulsatile organs became identical in any one bee. Furthermore, heated bees engaged in vigorous abdominal pumping at the same frequency as that of their heart and ventral diaphragm pulsations.\n\n“5. The results indicate that the anatomical counter-current heat exchanger is reduced or eliminated during heat stress by ‘chopping’ the blood flow into pulses, and the blood pulses are shunted through the petiole alternately by way of a switch mechanism.”"}, {"Source": "caterpillar's stitch", "Application": "machine capable of reshaping", "Function1": "reshape leaf", "Function2": "build shelter", "Function3": "protect from predator", "Function4": "generate silk", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/caterpillars-roll-leaves/", "Strategy": "Caterpillars Reshape Leaves With Silk\n\nCaterpillars use stitches made with contracting silk threads to roll leaves into a tube-shaped shelter \nIntroduction \n\nIn the rich foliage of a cherry tree, some remarkable moving and shaking is going on. With the intensity of a camper trying to set up a tent before an impending thunderstorm starts, a cherry leaf roller (Caloptilia serotinella) caterpillar is turning a leaf into a tube-shaped shelter to protect itself from predators.\nHow does this caterpillar pull off this physically demanding task—the equivalent of a human rolling up a room-sized carpet without using their hands? The key to its success is a tool literally right in front of its face: a collection of organs called spinnerets that produce a stretchy, strong silk that can exert a force strong enough to roll the leaf into a curl.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe cherry leaf roller starts its construction project by crawling along the underside of a leaf, biting chunks out of the tough vein that runs down the middle to allow it to be more easily rolled up.\nWhen it gets to the tip of the leaf, the caterpillar starts to extrude silk from its spinnerets. It attaches one end of the fiber to the tip of the leaf and the other to a point on or near the underside of the leaf some 10 millimeters (a half-inch) or so away, stretching the strand out like a rubber band before attaching. Each strand creates a tiny amount of “pull,” and together, many strands create enough tension to cause the leaf to start to curl.\nLike a living metronome set at a half-second pace, the caterpillar swings its head back and forth between the gradually curling tube and the part of the leaf that is still flat, attaching new strands as it inches its way from the tip to the stem. Like any good worker, the leaf roller takes a break once in a while, interspersing 7 minutes or so of intense spinning with about 6 minutes of other activities.\nAfter 4 to 10 hours, when it has spun thousands of strands and about three-quarters of the leaf is rolled, the caterpillar moves over to one side of the roll and, rapidly and repeatedly reaching up and down, pulls it shut with more tightly stretched strands of silk. Finally, it seals the opposite edge, locking itself in a cozy shelter with abundant food (it slowly eats the rolled up layers of leafy goodness)–securely out of sight and reach of predators.\n\nThe Potential \n\nPeople have used caterpillar silk as a fiber for textiles for thousands of years. But that’s just the beginning of the benefit we might derive from knowing about this incredible material and how caterpillars make and use it. Silk offers inspiration for tapping the multiple traits of a substance that changes from one state (liquid) to another (solid) to benefit from characteristics of both (flexibility, strength).\nThe cherry leaf roller, with its rapid-fire constricting-strands construction technique, provides valuable insights into how builders might capitalize on momentum and the physical properties of materials to exert a force that can move or reshape an object. The strategy can also inform other efforts to develop better ways to attach surfaces to each other, including wound edges, fabrics, furniture, infrastructure, and more."}, {"Source": "matrix", "Application": "artificial cartilage material", "Function1": "dynamic mechanical behavior", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/matrix-supports-tissue-engineering/", "Strategy": "Matrix Supports Tissue Engineering\n\nThe matrix associated with individual chondrocytes and other stem cells manages varying demands over time during the tissue engineering process by having temporally dynamic mechanical properties.\n“Cell-based tissue engineering holds great potential for therapies involving regeneration and/or replacement of damaged cartilage…The ultimate goal and challenge is to produce a material with structural, biochemical and biomechanical properties similar enough to healthy cartilage so that upon maturation in vivo it can restore physiological function. To achieve this objective, it is important to understand the temporal evolution of the properties of the newly synthesized matrix. At early stages, matrix is formed around individual cells within the scaffold and these cell–matrix composites are often isolated from each other. As culture time increases, growth of neighboring cell-associated matrices leads to the formation of a more continuous neo-tissue which undergoes further evolution in structure and properties in vitro or in vivo. Throughout this process, the cell-associated matrix is important in facilitating cell signaling and mechanotransduction (Millward-Sadler et al.,2000; Millward-Sadler and Salter, 2004). Knowledge of the properties of the in vitro-generated matrix provides an assessment of the quality and ultimate success of a given tissue engineering approach and has great potential to be utilized for optimization…the present study investigates the dynamic oscillatory mechanical behavior (Mahaffy et al., 2000, 2004; Alcaraz et al., 2003; Park et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2005) of the cell-associated matrices of individual chondrocytes cultured in alginate scaffolds up to 28 days. Such time-dependent behaviors are important because tissue-engineered constructs implanted in vivo are expected to undergo cyclic and impact loading that includes frequency components as high as 1kHz, just as native cartilage does…\n\n“In summary, our AFM-based approach has enabled the measurement of the poroelastic dynamic mechanical behavior of the newly developing matrix associated with individual chondrocytes, and can be applied generally to study the dynamic behavior of extremely compliant (~kPa) biological, porous, and hydrated systems at nm-length scales over a broad range of frequencies. The high resolution dynamic mechanical approach described here is able to discern fine differences in the development and maturation of the cell-associated matrix temporally and with the addition of growth factors. The methodologies reported here can thus be employed to assess maturation of matrix synthesized by primary chondrocytes and, additionally, by other cells such as stem cells undergoing chondrogenesis in applications for cartilage tissue engineering.

Seventeen-year cicadas, which exist only in North America, slurp plant root sap beneath the ground for nearly two decades before surfacing and molting their shells to become breeding adults.\n\nThe Onondaga nation marks the time a brood of 17-year cicadas sprouted from the ground after George Washington’s 1779 scorched-earth campaign left the people with no crops, giving them an emergency food source that enabled them to survive.\n\nNow, cicadas may provide another means for human survival. Recent science shows that tiny structures on cicada wings kill bacteria, which could give us another way to fight germs that kill millions of people each year. \n\nThe Strategy \n\nIn 2012, scientists observed that cicada wings kill several types of harmful bacteria, but it wasn’t immediately clear how it worked. Were the wings coated in an antibiotic? Was there a rapid immune response? Using powerful microscopes to get an extremely close view of the wings, the scientists observed tiny cone-shaped bumps called nanopillars covering both sides in a hexagonal arrangement.\n\nThey hypothesized it was actually the cones themselves that were killing the bacteria, and they used “the Midas touch” to prove it. They coated cicada wings with a super thin layer of gold to inhibit any biochemical reactions. When exposed to the gold-plated cicada wings, bacteria still died, proving there was no chemical killer—the unique nanopillar structures were directly responsible.\n\nTo understand how the cones kill bacteria, think of a bacterial cell like a water balloon. With a diameter several times larger than the distance between cones, one cell rests on many nanopillars. It’s tempting to think of these nanopillars as a bed of nails that simply pop the water balloon. However, in 2013, the same group of scientists developed a model that told a different story.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFor centuries, the concept of bacterial infection went undiscovered, postponing the war we’d eventually wage against it. In the 1860s, French microbiologist Louis Pasteur kicked the battle off by finally proving that germs cause infection. Shortly after, he invented pasteurization to make some beverages safer to drink.\n\nJoseph Lister, a surgeon, quickly applied Pasteur’s work to hospitals, developing the first sterilizing technique to cleanse instruments, hands, and wounds with carbolic acid. Then in 1928, Scottish researcher Alexander Fleming accidentally discovered penicillin, sparking decades of antibiotic research.\n\nNow that some bacteria are developing resistance to antibiotics, we need to look to nature to help us discover new ways of fighting infection.\n\nCicada wing nanopillars may be the next weapon in our germ arsenal.

The major structural difference between the two secretions is the presence of specific proteins in the adhesive mucus. This study identifies similar proteins from the glue of the slug Arion subfuscus and the land snail Helix aspersa. To investigate the role played by these proteins in adhesion, the proteins were isolated from the adhesive mucus of different molluscs and added to commercial polymer solutions. The effect was observed qualitatively, and quantified using a dynamic rheometer. The isolated proteins triggered gelling or visible stiffening of agar, pectin and polygalacturonic acid. The effect was stronger on more negatively charged polymers. The effect of the proteins was concentration dependent with an optimal concentration of 1–1.5 mg per ml, and was weakened when their structure changed. Other proteins and carbohydrates found in the adhesive mucus had no clear mechanical effect on gels. These findings show that the addition of these proteins to large, anionic polymers plays a central role in the formation of a glue from a mucus-like secretion.

This chemical language communicates detailed information regarding what specific kind of insect pest is causing damage to the plant, and thus attracts the appropriate pest-eating insect to “rescue” it by killing off the pest.\n\nDamage from insect feeding elicits the release of signaling molecules systemically within the plant. These signaling molecules turn on genes for the production of volatile compounds, acids and alcohols which evaporate into the surrounding air to communicate the presence of the pest insect to pest-eating insects. Plants can recognize various insect pests by proteins in their oral secretions, as well as by the type of damage they cause. For example, piercing and sucking insects (such as whiteflies and aphids) elicit different signaling molecules than chewing insects (such as caterpillars). Because the signaling molecules elicited by different insect pests vary, the genes activated for volatile compound production are unique to that pest species, alone. The result is that the plant produces a specific volatile blend that attracts the most appropriate pest-eating insect.\n\nThe release of plant volatiles can be stimulated by an attack from a wide range of insect species, from mountain pine beetles to aphids. Furthermore, the type of pest-eating insect that is attracted to the plant’s volatiles can vary from parasite to predator. In fact, plant volatiles can be perceived by any insect or plant in the surrounding area that stands to benefit from knowing the status of the plant. A community benefit of this volatile chemical communication strategy is that, because the chemicals are airborne, plants in close proximity to the affected plant receive a warning of the impending danger.\n\nA better understanding of how plants are able to naturally limit pest control could lead to solutions for more sustainable agriculture."}, {"Source": "african beetle", "Application": "water lung", "Function1": "breathe underwater", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bubble-allows-breathing-underwater/", "Strategy": "Bubble Allows Breathing Underwater\n\nThe Potamodytes beetle creates an underwater respiratory bubble via Bernoulli's principle.\n\n“One beetle, Potamodytes tuberosus, contrives to get the pressure in the bubble below atmospheric, taking advantage of the pressure drop attending fluid flow.

Objects submerged in water can become covered by unwanted films of bacteria or larger organisms such as algae and barnacles. This is referred to as biofouling. Biofouling can negatively impact an organism’s health and performance, and many marine organisms have mechanisms to resist biofouling. Sharks have long caught the attention of scientists because unlike other large marine animals, they seem to rarely suffer from biofouling.\n\nBiofouling begins when microorganisms make a transition between their free-floating form to their attached, stationary lifestyle. Called initial attachment, these organisms cling to the surface via weak and reversible forces. Initial attachment gives way to irreversible attachment when these organisms chemically bind to the surface by secreting an adhesive substance. It is best to avoid irreversible attachment by preventing initial settlement in the first place.\n\nShark skin is made up of microscopic scales that are triangular in shape and generally 200-500 μm long, with fine regularly spaced (30–100 μm) ridges aligned along the body axis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the scales can alter the flow of water closest to the skin and potentially reduce drag on the body (more info here). The same mechanism could help prevent biofouling since fast flowing water near the skin’s surface would reduce the time microorganisms have to settle on the surface as well as help wash away any that do settle. Another hypothesis is that the shark scale’s microscopic shape and surface topography deter the settlement of microorganisms. This idea has yet to be experimentally tested on real shark skin, but is based on studies of shark skin replicas and simple models that show certain microorganisms prefer colonizing particular groove widths and depths. More experimental research is needed to determine exactly how shark scales influence microorganism attachment.\n\nAlthough these mechanisms are still being examined in the organism itself, shark dermal denticles have inspired a successful commercial antifouling product called Sharklet AF™.

Sugar gliders and squirrel gliders can reach up to 50 meters, while yellow-bellied gliders are able to cover distances of up to 140 meters in one leap. How do they do it?\n\nThe Strategy \n\nGliding possums are able to drift between trees due to a “gliding membrane”- a thin sheet of skin that stretches between the wrists and ankles on both sides of the body. Gliding through the air allows these mammals to reach distant food resources, escape predators, and return to nests. This allows the possum to save more energy and time than it would if it was foraging on the ground.\n\nTo begin gliding, possums leap from high up in a tree, and spread out their limbs to pull the membrane taught. This increases the total surface area, which increases lift and decreases drag, allowing the possum to stay in the air for longer. The leap begins at a downward angle, but as the possum picks up speed, the angle of flight flattens out. The possum’s prehensile tip on its tail acts as a rudder, steering its body towards the desired location. As the possum begins to land, it brings its hind legs closer to its body, making a ‘nose-up’ position, to finally land on all fours.\n\nThe Potential \n\nAir travel contributes about 12 % of transportation emissions in the U.S. The more planes glide, the less fuel they consume.

The bacteria that had been living harmoniously within the deer immediately set about breaking its carcass down.\n\nGreen bottle flies, which have a nose for the dead, are usually the first wave of insects that dive into the decay. They lay their eggs in dead flesh to give their soon-to-hatch larvae, known as maggots, immediate food. The thought of squirming maggots devouring the rotting deer may seem sad or gross, but it’s the ultimate form of recycling. One animal dies and becomes the birthplace and food source of many others.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nGreen bottle flies are first at the scene of death, not because they’re ghoulish, but because their maggot offspring need soft dead tissue to eat. Maggots lack the teeth or beaks that would enable them to tear into old, dried-out meat, but the little larvae still have bite. Their mouth hooks and rough skin scrape away dead flesh as they crawl across a carcass. Then they secrete enzymes that liquefy the dead tissue, making it easier to swallow and digest.\n\nMaggot salivary glands, guts, and other digestive organs secrete the enzymes, called “peptidases,” which work by breaking down proteins. Maggot secretions don’t just contain a pinch of peptidase; they are more like enzyme stew. Scientists used genetic sequencing of their secretions to identify 185 individual peptidase enzymes.\n\nFor the record, all biological organisms—including plants, viruses, and people—use peptidases. These enzymes play critical roles in metabolism, reproduction, growth, and immune systems. While the functions of some individual peptidases are known, others are not. Moreover, their actions and mechanisms vary across species.\n\nMaggot enzymes reduce inflammation, eliminate bacteria, coagulate blood, and stimulate healing responses—all good things when trying to clean chronic wounds and infections.\n\nScientists are still learning how the green bottle fly maggot benefits from its abundance of enzymes, but one effect beneficial to humans is that their secretions help wounds heal. Maggot enzymes reduce inflammation, eliminate bacteria, coagulate blood, and stimulate healing responses—all good things when trying to clean chronic wounds and infections.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThere are accounts of caregivers making use of maggots to help heal wounds among the Maya, Aboriginal Australians, and other indigenous cultures. In Renaissance Europe, the benefits were acknowledged but not cultivated. By the time of the U.S. Civil War, at least one surgeon was intentionally applying maggots to the wounds of soldiers, saying, “In a single day, [maggots] would clean a wound much better than any agents we had at our command.” Maggot wound therapy declined with the advent of antibiotics but rebounded with the rise of drug-resistant bacteria.\n\nToday, “maggot wound debridement” remains an alternative therapy for treating persistent wounds and infections in patients with severe burns, diabetes, and other ailments that hinder healing.\n\nSome researchers are even going beyond “bio-utilizing” maggots directly on wounds. Isolating and reproducing maggot enzymes has already led to gels that mimic how medicinal maggots help people on the mend. In the future, understanding maggot secretions may lead to new antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medicines, and coagulants.\n\nMaggots exemplify why we shouldn’t judge organisms as good or bad based on appearances or habits we find off-putting.

It is home to 400 kinds of coral and thousands of other species. Threats like bleaching due to climate change, cyclones and invasive species can cause serious damage to these critical marine habitats.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nBut when disaster strikes a reef, its neighbors can provide emergency aid to help restore it. Researchers say the best “rescue reefs,” known as refugia, have three important traits. First, historical patterns show they are less likely than others in the system to be inundated by warm water that leads to bleaching due to their location. Second, models of ocean currents suggest they are sufficiently connected by moving water to other reefs in the system during spawning season. This link helps coral larvae and other living things travel to and colonize the devastated areas to replenish them. Third, surveys show refugia are less likely than others to be infested with invasive crown-of-thorns starfish, whose larvae could travel to the injured reefs along with the desirable coral larvae.\n\nIn recent research, scientists mapped reefs that have each of these helpful traits. By combining the maps, they identified a few protected and connected areas. Each can serve as a seed for other parts of the Great Barrier Reef after they sustain injury. Keeping these refugia safe from damage such as development and pollution can boost the overall resilience of the Great Barrier Reef, scientists say.\n\nThe Potential \n\nMany disturbed natural and human systems could benefit from this ecosystem approach to disaster recovery. Fire ravages forests. Floods destroy cities. Pandemics devastate economies. To use it, we must first identify likely threats to the system. Next, we should look for parts of the system that are less vulnerable to these threats. Does a forest contain isolated patches of trees that are less susceptible to fire? Is there high ground in a community that would be safe from a flood? Where are a city’s essential businesses that must operate through an emergency? Then we must work to protect these valuable assets from other sources of destruction, such as logging, urban blight or  poor business practices.

Groundwater flows through the root zone of the forest also resulted in a 50 percent drop in dissolved nitrate reaching the river. The amount of material removed by this one narrow band of forest led the researchers to suggest ‘coupling natural systems and managed habitats within a watershed’ to buffer open waters from pollution. This is a key service of biodiversity that, until recent times, could easily be taken for granted.

They’re a key to their survival. When these reptiles sight prey, they launch their tongues like missiles and strike with stunning speed and force.

Half the fibers spiral clockwise and half anticlockwise. Together they form a diagonally crosshatched pattern that looks like the stretchy plastic mesh sleeves used to protect glass bottles.\n\nWhen chameleons sight prey, they get ready, aim, and “load” their tongues by contracting their tongue muscles. The muscles squeeze inward around the collagen fibers, compressing them into tight coils. The fibers are now packed with stored energy, like a jack-in-the-box ready to pop.\n\nThe muscles and compressed collagen layers slide forward along the well-lubricated bone. At its tip, the bone thickness tapers down sharply, expanding the space for the collagen fibers. Suddenly uncompressed, the fibers spring forward, powered by their own momentum. Stored potential energy reverts to kinetic energy, amplifying the tongue’s speed and power. It shoots out at accelerations of 2,590 meters per second squared, or 264 G (faster than a fighter jet), and smashes its sticky tip into its prey within two-hundredths of a second.\n\nThe Potential \n\nChameleons’ highly refined and coordinated tongue system offers intriguing blueprints for scientists to explore ways to engineer projectile-motion mechanical systems and materials that store and release energy more efficiently, generate higher speed and power, and continue to work well in cold temperatures.

The outer part of the stem is made up of gluelike pectin, gum, chemicals that impart color, and bast fibers, which surround the inner, woody part of the stem and provide structure to the part of the stem through which water and nutrients can flow.\n\nWhen a fibrous plant dies naturally or is harvested, microbes in the environment around it start gnawing away at these softer tissues. They use specialized enzymes to break down the structures that make up the various components of stems into small molecules, providing food for themselves in the process.\n\nThe type of microorganism that does the job depends on the setting. On land, the decomposers tend to be fungi that require oxygen to function. In freshwater, bacteria, particularly Clostridia, do the job. In saltwater, scientists have identified two kinds of bacteria normally found in the soil, Stenotrophomnas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum anthropi, as the primary degraders.\n\nDegraders use enzymes called pectinases to break down the pectin found in the cell walls and the matter between cells. They break down cellulose and hemicellulose with cellulases and hemicellulases. Relatively few, however, are able to make much of a dent in the central, woody part of the stem. As a result, the outer materials essentially get eaten away, leaving a clean fiber in much the same way as a dog gnawing on a bone removes every bit of meat and gristle but leaves the bone relatively intact.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThat’s good news for those of us who wear clothes. When manufacturers make textiles from natural fibers, they first need to strip all of the non-fiber bits away. One way to do that is to use harsh chemicals, but as concern grows for protecting the environment, manufacturers are turning to decomposers instead. The right mix can remove the undesirable part of fiber plants, freeing up the sturdy insides for use in fashioning fashion."}, {"Source": "flax plant's fiber", "Application": "structural materials", "Function1": "strong strength", "Function2": "cross-linked composites", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/matrix-produces-strong-structural-materials/", "Strategy": "Matrix Produces Strong Structural Materials\n\nFibers produced by the flax plant provide strength by being extensively cross-linked composites of cellulose, pectin, and protein in a long, tube-like architecture.\nFlax fiber has been used for millenia throughout the world for the production of linen textile.

The wild potato (Solanum berthaultii), native to Bolivia, defends itself from aphids by emitting a pheromone that mimics the insects’ own alarm pheromone, thereby distracting the insects with a false danger.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nWhen attacked by predators, aphids emit a chemical signal that acts as an alarm to other aphids nearby, giving them a head start to flee from the area. The wild potato has adapted to put this behavior to work as a defense of its own. \n\nPotato plants expel a pheromone similar enough to the aphid alarm pheromone to have the same effect, causing the destructive insects to disperse. The aphids keep a distance of 1-3 mm. Even entire colonies that have already settled on the plant take off when exposed to this pheromone mimic.\n\nThe wild potato’s defense pheromone is released from two types of tiny hairs on its leaves and stems: the type A hairs, which are shorter and rupture when touched to expel the pheromone, and the type B hairs, which form drops of the pheromone at their tips.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe cultivated potato, a major food crop, is also fed on by aphids, but unlike its wild relative, it doesn’t have its own pheromone mimic to protect itself.

Well known and widespread is the regurgitation of oral secretion (OS), fluid that repels attacking predators. In herbivores, the effectiveness of OS has been ascribed so far to the presence of deterrent secondary metabolites sequestered from the host plant. This notion implies, however, that generalists experience less protection on plants with low amounts of secondary metabolites or with compounds ineffective against potential enemies. Resolving the dilemma, we describe a novel defence mechanism that is independent of deterrents as it relies on the intrinsic detergent properties of the OS. The OS of Spodoptera exigua (and other species) was found to be highly amphiphilic and well capable of wetting the hydrophobic cuticle of predatory ants. As a result, affected ants stopped attacking and engaged in extensive cleansing. The presence of surfactants was sufficient to explain the defensive character of herbivore OS. We hypothesize that detergency is a common but unrecognized mode of defence, which provides a base level of protection that may or may not be further enhanced by plant-derived deterrents.

These organisms, which form a kingdom all on their own, come in virtually endless sizes and shapes, from single-celled yeasts to massive, web-like organisms that stretch for miles underground. They make their way through life by tapping into resources few if any others want—horse manure, fallen leaves, dead animals, and the like—and breaking down the natural chemicals they contain into a source of energy and molecules to nourish themselves. Some fungi can use the same molecules that help them obtain food to break down artificial chemicals with which we humans have contaminated the environment.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nAll living things contain enzymes, proteins they use to break or make chemical bonds. By holding two or more molecules close to each other in a position that encourages them to react with each other, enzymes allow their owners to transform one substance into another, creating the molecules they need to provide structure, produce energy, and more.\n\nAs organisms that specialize in decomposing other living (or formerly living) things, fungi have a particularly impressive variety of enzymes they can use to break down a wide variety of chemicals to extract the energy and molecules they need to live. Scientists searching for ways to remove human-made pollutants from the environment have discovered that some fungi can use their enzymes to degrade these undesirable chemicals.\n\nContaminants that fungi have been found to break down include polyaromatic hydrocarbons (such as those found in crude oil and gasoline), heavy metals, herbicides, pesticides, cyanotoxins, pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, phthalates, dyes, and detergents. Often, the enzymes they use to do this are also ones they normally would use to break down lignin, the molecule that helps give plants their stiff structure. But other enzymes appear to be involved as well. The chemical reactions include removing oxygen or hydrogen, altering the configuration of chemical bonds, and more. Such changes, in some cases, can turn toxic substances into harmless molecules such as carbohydrates, water, and oxygen.\n\nThe Potential \n\nConventional processes for removing pollutants such as industrial waste, paints, and pesticides from land and water can be expensive, energy-demanding, and of limited effectiveness. Sometimes they even produce other undesirable molecules in the process. The right kinds of fungi could be introduced to a contaminated site though and begin to do the job themselves? This process, known as mycoremediation, uses other forms of life to accomplish tasks directly (as opposed to adapting lessons from them into new innovations) and so is a form of bioutilization. There is a very good reason why we don’t generally just put fungi into an environment to let them take care of our pollution: it is very difficult to scale. Fungi convert the pollution we have created at a much slower rate than we create it. Genetic modification could enhance the efficiency of some contaminant-degrading fungi though, or enable them to specialize in certain pollutants. Scientists are also exploring ways to introduce certain bacteria or natural chemicals such as cellulose to make fungi’s natural abilities more effective. This ability to take up toxic substances could also be used to improve recycling and decrease mining by “harvesting” precious metals from e-waste, wastewater, or naturally occurring deposits."}, {"Source": "sandpiper's bill", "Application": "surface tension transport", "Function1": "change surface tension", "Function2": "transport feeding", "Function3": "draw food", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bird-bill-draws-food-into-mouth/", "Strategy": "Bird Bill Draws Food Into Mouth\n\nThe bill of the sandpiper draws food into its mouth using water’s surface tension.\n\nThe western sandpiper (Calidris mauri) is a shorebird that spends its winters on the coasts of the US. Probing in mud and sand with its long bill, the sandpiper picks up small prey like marine worms, crustaceans, and insects. It can also feed on tiny plankton floating in the water, but these prey are too small to probe or peck at individually. To eat plankton, the western sandpiper uses a strategy called “surface tension transport.”\n\nWater has a surface tension that results from attractive forces between water molecules. At an air-water interface, this surface tension tends to keep the interface as small as possible. Spreading water out and creating more interface takes energy. Water molecules are also attracted to keratin, the protein material that makes up the sandpiper’s bill. As it wades along the shore, the sandpiper dips the tip of its bill into the water and grasps at plankton like a pair of tweezers. It then lifts its bill out of the water and opens the bill slightly. The plankton-rich drop of water at the bill tip sticks to the upper and lower bill and stretches apart, creating an air-water interface. As the sandpiper continues to open its bill, the water drop continues to stretch. Water’s surface tension then reduces the stretched interface area by moving the drop up towards the sandpiper’s mouth.

They may be tiny, but they’re performing many of the same tasks as the largest multicellular organisms, and their size actually opens up interesting possibilities and alternatives for them.\n\nTo get energy to live and grow, some bacteria build electrical “wires” 100,000 times thinner than a human hair. They extend these nanowires outside their cell walls and create a microscopic electrical grid in the surrounding environment. The nanowires allow the bacteria to “breathe,” using metals instead of oxygen.\n\nLiving things generate energy by breaking down bigger chemical compounds into smaller ones through a series of chemical reactions known as cellular respiration. In each reaction, chemical bonds are broken, releasing electrons that are transported from compound to compound. At each step, the electrons give up a little more of their energy, which is siphoned off to do work that keeps cells alive. At the end of this cascade, the energy-reduced electrons must find a final resting place in the atomic orbit of some element or compound.\n\nHumans and many other organisms use oxygen to accept these electrons because it is readily available in the atmosphere and can be directly absorbed or inhaled. This is known as aerobic respiration. Many bacteria, however, live deep in sediments where oxygen does not penetrate, and must use another electron acceptor. This is known as anaerobic respiration, or respiration without oxygen.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nMetals such as iron, manganese, and arsenic—and even radioactive uranium—readily accept excess electrons, and they are commonly found in soil. But here’s the hitch: Bacteria can’t bring metals inside their cell walls, because the metals are too big, or toxic to the bacteria, or stuck to other surfaces. So the bacteria have to export their excess electrons outside, in a process known as extracellular respiration.\n\nThat’s where the nanowires come in. The bacteria use proteins to build thin structures 3 to 5 nanometers in diameter, about the size of a strand of human DNA. These nanowires extend beyond the bacterial cell walls, where they connect with the metals in surrounding sediments or water. Often, multitudes of bacteria assemble into a slimy biofilm, which can contain a whole network of nanowires.\n\nThe Potential \n\nAdding on electrons causes changes in metals. Instead of being dissolved in water, they form solid compounds. In solid forms, they are less toxic. They don’t spread widely into the environment and can be more easily removed.\n\nNanowired bacteria could help clean up sites polluted by toxic metals from industry and sewage. In addition, scientists are exploring ways to build bacterial nanowire systems to create fuel cells that use bacteria to generate energy, and bioelectronic devices that can be used to conduct electricity in water.\n\nDestroying nanowire systems could have benefits as well: Medical researchers are investigating ways to knock out disease-causing microbes by disrupting their nanowires."}, {"Source": "fire-bellied toad's antimicrobial peptide", "Application": "antimicrobial therapies", "Function1": "avoid microbes' resistance", "Function2": "prevent infection", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/brain-fights-microbes/", "Strategy": "Toad Brains Fight Deadly Microbes\n\nAntimicrobial peptides protect the brains of fire-bellied toads from microbes.\n\nIntroduction \n\nFire-bellied toads (Bombina species), found in Asia and Europe, get their name from their brightly-colored undersides. Two of the species, the large-webbed bell toad (B. maxima) and the small-webbed bell toad (B. microdeladigitora) share another noteworthy trait in addition to their name and coloration: Their brains contain large numbers of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a class of powerful germ-killing molecules.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAMPs are not in themselves rare or unusual molecules. Made of various combinations of short-chain amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, they are found in most living things. These amino acids have different segments that can penetrate the different layers of a cell membrane. This gives them the ability to poke holes in the membranes surrounding bacteria and microscopic fungi in a variety of different ways, causing the cells’ contents to leak out and the microbes to die. AMPs usually target the cell membrane itself, rather than interacting with receptors on the membrane surface. As a result, it is much more difficult for microbes to evolve resistance to AMPs compared with conventional antibiotics.\n\nAmphibians in particular are known for their abundant AMPs. Lacking hair or scales, these animals rely directly on their skin surface to protect them from germs. And AMPs help the skin deliver: In many species, external glands secrete AMPs onto the skin, where they can attach to and destroy infection-causing microorganisms. Scientists have identified some 300 or more kinds of AMPs on frogs alone. But it turns out that could be just the tip of the iceberg. When scientists decided to look for AMPs elsewhere, they found signs of 52 kinds of AMPs in the large-webbed bell toad’s brain and 27 in the brain of its small-webbed relative. Of these, 59 are AMPs that have never been seen elsewhere. Some were only effective against a very limited set of microorganisms. Others were able to knock off multiple kinds of bacteria as well as fungi.\n\nScientists suspect that the AMPs found in the toads’ brains are helping protect them from infections that could harm their nervous systems. They also think that the difference in the kinds of AMPs found in the brains of the two species tested may be related to the different types of microbes found in the toads’ respective habitats, with B. maxima more likely to encounter germs found in ponds and B. microdeladigitora needing defense against those found in trees.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe newly discovered  AMPs in these toads’ brains open the door to a better understanding of how these small molecules can so effectively kill microbes. Because they can exist in the brain without harming brain tissue, they also offer an opportunity for gaining insights into how to make effective antimicrobial therapies that destroy germs without harming our own bodies. And they offer insights into how humans might develop new strategies for overcoming bacteria that have developed resistance to conventional antibiotics, with particular attention to those that attack human brains, causing life-threatening infections such as meningitis and encephalitis."}, {"Source": "mantis", "Application": "vibration detector", "Function1": "detect ultrasound", "Function2": "responds with erratic elusive behavior", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ultrasound-detection-rapid-response-evades-bats/", "Strategy": "Ultrasound Detection, Rapid Response Evades Bats\n\nThe body of the praying mantis evades bats by detecting ultrasonic sound and rapidly responding.\n\n“In tethered flight, Parasphendale agrionina (Gerst.) males respond to ultrasonic stimuli with a unique suite of behaviors that includes full extension of the forelegs, strong dorsiflexion of the abdomen, a head roll, a 5% decrease in wingbeat frequency and a 33% increase in forewing excursion…Several components of the in-flight evasive behavior resemble defensive displays on the ground, and we suggest that this mantis has responded to predation pressure from bats with both flight derived maneuvers and an aerial deimatic display.” "}, {"Source": "quiver tree's branch", "Application": "sun radiation filter", "Function1": "produce reflective coating of white powder", "Function2": "protect from the heat of the sun", "Function3": "keeping cool", "Function4": "hold water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/branches-protected-from-the-sun/", "Strategy": "Branches Protected From the Sun\n\nThe branches of a quiver tree are protected from the heat of the sun by a reflective coating of white powder.\n\n“The quiver tree that grows in the Namib is a kind of aloe.

However, at low speeds, or while hovering to drink nectar, achieving lift is not as easy. Increasing flapping frequency can help, but the Pallas’s long-tongued bat compensates for the lack of lift in one very special way: by flipping its wing inside-out on every upstroke.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nFlipping its wings keeps the bat airborne by creating pressure differences: above and below the wing, as well as along it. This pressure gradient creates vortices by causing air to move passively from the higher pressure area to the lower pressure area, which stirs up the air. As the wing flips between upside out and inside out during flight, pressure gradients are created that and generate vortices, which counteract air resistance and keep the bat in the air.\nThese vortices are created at different points along the wing, from the armpit to the wingtip, as well as at the leading (front) and trailing (back) edges of the wing. At the armpit, weaker vortices are overcome by stronger tip vortices, causing air to circulate along the bottom of the wings and back to the bat’s body. This air circulation creates the lift needed to counteract air resistance acting on the bat.\n\nThe vortex created at the trailing edge is weaker than at the leading edge, creating another pressure gradient. This creates additional vortices that provide their own lift and reinforce the effects of the circulating vortices created by the pressure differences under the wingtip and armpit. In this way, a bat’s wing acts like a flag in the wind. Unlike rigid tree branches or bird wings, flags bend, churning and spinning the air as it passes. Just as a flag flaps and curls on itself in the wind, the wings of Pallas’s long-tongued bats create similar vortices that generate lift.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFlexible wings may not be practical for passenger planes, but investigating flexible wing aerodynamics could help develop technologies for air-lifting materials. For example, instead of using heavy, power-intensive cranes, perhaps efficiently flapping drones could raise and lower materials. Renewable energy sources like wind turbines might generate more power with more dynamic turbines. It’s possible that understanding how bats maneuver their wings could even aid in the design of static elements like roof shingles that need to withstand windy days.\n\n"}, {"Source": "grapple plant's fruit", "Application": "grappling hooks", "Function1": "attach to animal", "Function2": "split automatically", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/seeds-are-dispersed-long-distances/", "Strategy": "Hooks Grab On to Carry Fruit Far\n\nThe fruit of the grapple plant hooks onto animals with a strong but temporary grip to disperse seeds over great distances.\nIntroduction \n\nThere is a group of plants (Harpagophytum) native to southern Africa that go by several colorful common names, including “grapple plant” and “devil’s claw.” As you can imagine, these plants have an arresting look to them: the ripened fruit resembles gnarled brown claws that point in all directions.\n\nGrapple plants are found in drier habitats such as overgrazed plains and fossil dunes made of windswept sand hardened into distinct formations by calcium carbonate. If seedlings were to grow near their parents, it would result in direct competition for scarce resources and space for their roots to grow. So it’s to the grapple plant’s benefit that its seed be carried as far away as possible. To make such considerable journeys, these plants rely on the feet or fur of large grazing animals.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe trick to hitching the right ride with an unsuspecting giant is in those hooks: they must be catchy enough to carry the fruit for a good while, but also loose enough that it will eventually fall off. If the seeds are lucky, they will be dropped off where the soil hasn’t been depleted of water and nutrients from an overgrowth of other plants.\n\nThe grapple plant’s fruit is perfectly structured to be stepped on, wedged into the creases of the sole of a giant foot, and dragged long distances without damaging the seeds inside. It has a strong, woody seed pod that looks like it has already been flattened from above. Pointing outwards from all around the center of the flattened fruit are curled arms, and on the curled arms are the smaller hooks that keep the fruit attached to whatever part of an animal comes into contact with it. The pod starts to split along its side when it’s ripe, so it doesn’t need to be forced open like other types of seed pods.\n\nThere is also a group of plants (Proboscidea) in North America that belong to the same family (Pedaliaceae) as Harpagophytum and are also called devil’s claw, but have hooks of a more slender, arching form. Currently, only cattle transport the seeds because the large grazing animals these plants once relied on no longer share the same landscape.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe grapple plant has found a way to protect its seeds while also getting them transported long distances. Humans can take inspiration from the strength and form of the plant’s fruit for the design of products like shoe grips, grappling hooks,  and fasteners for clothing.

When times are good, it exists in its “plasmodium” form––a single cell with countless nuclei, spreading across damp surfaces near the forest floor as it grazes on microbes it finds there. When food and moisture are scarce, it forms a hard, stalked structure and releases spores that wind and rain can carry to new locations.

Those that fail to find food shrink back, leaving a trail that tells the organism not to bother heading that way again.\n\nThe Potential \n\nA slime mold’s approach to optimizing networks through exploration and reinforcement can be applied to enhancing efficiency in a wide range of human activities. Self-driving cars could use its algorithms to identify the best path to take to a destination in the context of real-time updates on road capacity, traffic volume, and intermittent obstacles. Infrastructure designers could apply it to designing efficient systems for rail transit, delivery routes, water pipes, power grids, and more. A slime mold itself can even be used to define optimal routes by creating a model of the routing puzzle for it to solve in real time.\n\nThe slime mold’s strategy might also be applied in search efforts, whether for lost hikers in a forest or for desired information online.

Found throughout the world in lakes, rivers, and oceans, diatoms pull the mineral silicona from the water around them and craft it into astoundingly intricate containers for themselves, with the shape varying from species to species. \n\nThis material is the strongest for its weight known in nature. And it gives its owners a variety of benefits. It protects from predators. It can use its lenslike properties to turn harmful ultraviolet light into rays the microbes can harvest for energy. And it can selectively allow nutrients in while filtering out harmful organisms.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nDiatoms craft for themselves a shell, called a frustule, from silicona, the material that makes glass and much of the world’s sand. Each frustule consists of a top and bottom that fit together like a candy box. And each species of diatom makes a structure of a characteristic shape—circular, rectangular,  even star-shaped—with a characteristic pattern of pores. The combination of pores and solid material give the shells remarkable structural strength for their weight. The way they are structured also helps keep diatoms close to the surface of the water, protects the diatom from bacteria and viruses, and converts harmful ultraviolet light into a wavelength the diatom can use to photosynthesize.\n\nThe process of making a frustule resembles an assembly line with various proteins as the line workers. Proteins known as silicic acid transporters move silicon from the surrounding water into a baglike structure inside the cell called a silica deposition vesicle. There, other proteins link silicona atoms together to form a hard structure. Some proteins, called silaffins, make bits with tiny pores. Others, called pleuralins, help connect the top and bottom parts of the box. Yet others, known as cingulins, help make bands that wrap around the structure and  hold it together. A sugar polymer known as chitin offers additional strength. Finally, the diatom coats the structure with organic materials known as long-chain polyamines. Scientists think these help create customized shapes for various species.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe biomimetic potential that diatom frustules offer is virtually endless. The porous construction offers insights for creating strong but lightweight materials for application in aeronautics, shipping, recreational equipment, and more.

Do you think it’s a mindless, automatic process, as innate as a baby learning to crawl? Or do you think it’s a more intentional, thoughtful process of experimentation and learning? Recent evidence is strongly pointing to the latter scenario, with implications for how humans attempt to teach machines, programs, and themselves to carry out any complex activity.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nTake, for starters, the process of selecting the perfect nest location. Birds of the same species tend to build their nests in similar types of locations, so for a long time scientists assumed that this behavior was genetically determined. However, studies have shown that nest site selection changes greatly depending on a number of factors such as weather, encounters with predators, past success, and what other birds in the area are doing.\n\nIn one study, when cold weather set in, pinyon jays in northern Arizona began building their nests in higher, more exposed locations, where the increased sunlight both kept the mother warm and helped melt snow around the nest. However, 25% of pinyon jays then stopped building nests in exposed sites after multiple encounters with predators.\n\nMany species, like kittiwakes and piping plovers, will adjust their nesting sites year to year based on their own reproductive success. If a bird fails to produce young that survive to the fledgling stage, the following year it will build a nest much farther away, whereas a successful bird will stay in roughly the same area.\n\nEven more interestingly, birds who fail to breed will peek at their neighbors’ nests to help them decide where to build next. A study showed that piping plovers with unsuccessful neighbors chose sites 34 times further away the following year compared to birds with successful neighbors.\n\nThe Potential \n\nSuch research makes a strong case for nest-building as a carefully considered and constantly adapting endeavor, rather than a purely inherited, mechanical behavior. As humans seek to adapt fundamental processes in construction and other areas to changing conditions, there is much to learn from and admire about the methods birds have employed to be so successful. And it begs the question: how did we learn to build in the first place?"}, {"Source": "dolphin's whistle", "Application": "acoustic modem", "Function1": "prevent messages from being distorted", "Function2": "maintaining transmission of message", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/whistles-compensate-for-underwater-sound-distortion/", "Strategy": "Whistles Compensate for\nUnderwater Sound Distortion\n\nDolphins send out broadband whistles and bursts of clicks to prevent messages from being distorted underwater.\n\nIntroduction \n\nFrom early childhood most of us have been taught that dolphins use sound waves both to “see” underwater and to communicate with each other. If this doesn’t impress you, then you have not yet fully considered the challenges presented by trying to hear and be heard underwater. The dolphins’ solution to these challenges is so effective that it’s inspiring a wave of new underwater communication devices.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhile humans produce sound by pushing air past vibrating tissues in our throat, dolphins have vibrating tissues in their nasal passages, called “phonic lips.” The sounds they produce typically fall into three categories: whistles, clicks, and burst pulses (rapid series of clicks). Clicks are used mainly for echolocation and hunting, and span a narrow range of frequencies. Whistles and burst pulses are used more for communication between dolphins, and span a wide range of frequencies, low to high, even outside the range of human hearing. The “broadband” nature of these whistles and burst pulses can actually help ensure a dolphin’s message is not distorted as it travels to its intended recipient.\n\nSuppose you’re a dolphin swimming through shallow, pristine waters, trying to get a signal to a fellow dolphin about the location of food. You emit a sound, a wave that propagates through the water and can be picked up by your peer. However, the sound wave you emitted propagates in all directions: it also travels to the surface of the water and the ocean floor, bouncing off of both and eventually colliding with the other parts of the wave. This is called interference, and it is just one of many problems posed for any organism trying to make sense of a sound signal underwater. Researchers have confirmed, however, that broadband signals compensate for this interference. If a portion of a signal gets interfered with at one frequency, it may still get through at another, and a whole message can be transmitted without distortion of meaning.\n\nThe Potential \n\nA company called EvoLogics has employed this solution to design a highly effective “acoustic modem,” which encodes information as sound waves, transmits them, and decodes them on the other end. The device is currently being used for tsunami monitoring systems, underwater exploration vehicles, and even an underwater telescope built to detect neutrinos—subatomic particles emitted by stars and supernovae. In this way, dolphins are helping us save lives, see parts of the ocean we’ve never seen before, and learn more about the fundamental laws of the universe."}, {"Source": "corel's rock-hard reef", "Application": "durable materials", "Function1": "form rock-hard surface", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/how-proteins-help-corals-build-rock-hard-reefs/", "Strategy": "How Proteins Help Corals\nBuild Rock‑Hard Reefs\n\nCorals lay down proteins in an organized way to create a scaffold for minerals that produce rock-hard reefs\nIntroduction \n\nSome of the most extensive structures on Earth are made not by humans or beavers or other big builders, but by countless generations of tiny creatures beneath the surface of the sea.\n\nEach coral individual contributes to the reef that large populations of them form, helping to provide a vast home to an abundance of fish and other ocean-going animals. But until recently, humans hadn’t known exactly how the jelly-bean-sized invertebrates produce these massive, rock-hard habitats. Now, new information on how proteins interact with each other to form molecular scaffolds for rock crystals is offering valuable insights into how corals create—and how humans might create—durable structures that can stand up to saltwater, strong currents, and more.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nCorals start their lives as floating larvae called planulae. When they settle down, they take on a baglike polyp form and begin their work.\n\nFirst, a set of proteins containing collagens, laminins, fibronectin, and USOMP13 form a scaffold. Second, molecules called coral acid-rich proteins (CARP) attach to the collagens, pull calcium carbonate from the water, and shape it into a needlelike form called aragonite.\n\nThe corals then combine these aragonite crystals with sugars, fats, and more than a hundred kinds of proteins—at least one of which is similar to a protein that helps shape human bones. The organic molecules act like cement, gluing bits of aragonite together to form the literally rock-hard surface we know as coral skeletons. These structures provide some protection from predators for the invertebrate engineers that make them, and provide surfaces that other corals can attach to.\n\nThe Potential \n\nCorals’ capacity to make uniquely shaped, durable structures using a well-organized combination of minerals and organic molecules could find countless applications in the pursuit of engineering that respects, protects, and emulates nature. Scientists and engineers growing prosthetic bone could use the spatial arrangements coral researchers have uncovered as an inspiration for enhancing strength and durability of prosthetics.

They tether themselves to rocks or each other with stringy fibers called byssal threads. Each thread has a foamy adhesive “plaque” at the end containing a mixture of proteins that give mussels their amazing adhesive qualities.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nBefore it makes byssal threads, a mussel’s foot snakes out of its shell, probing for a suitable place to stick. When the foot is ready to attach, it secretes a series of liquid proteins in a specific sequence, which quickly solidify. Some, mostly collagen (the same protein that makes skin stretchy), become the thin but strong thread itself. Others form a hard protective coating around both the plaque and thread. And just a few of the proteins are adhesive and form the anchoring plaque.\n\nWhat makes these proteins so sticky is that they contain high concentrations of a special molecule called L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, or dopa. Dopa sticks very easily to many surfaces, including famously non-stick ones like Teflon, because of how it bonds chemically to them. Each molecule contains side chains that share electrons with rocky surfaces, forming phenomenally strong bonds.\n\nBut just like the primer you have to apply to wood before you paint it, scientists have recently discovered that another protein, lysine (lys), helps prepare the wet surfaces for dopa.\n\nThe Potential \n\nDeveloping underwater adhesives, of course, has many maritime applications. But artificial mussel glues might also save lives. Because bodily fluids also contain salts, similar adhesives could result in new methods for closing wounds and incisions. Mussel adhesives might also transform surgery on babies in the womb, enabling surgeons to reseal incisions made in the amniotic sac, which is too fragile for traditional suturing or other techniques.\n\nMussel-based adhesives could also help preserve our oceans. Coral reefs provide food and shelter to 25% of ocean species, yet they face serious risks of global extinction. Restoring reefs can involve transplanting thriving sections to less healthy areas, but they need a biofriendly glue to fix them in place.

In response, the snake lets out a loud bellowing sound that earns it the name of “bull snake.”\n\nNo other genus of snake is known to make such a sound. What’s going on?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen a bull snake, gopher snake, or pine snake (all members of the genus Pituophis) is attacked or frightened it makes two defensive noises. Both noises result from when the snake forces air through its larynx while exhaling, similar to how humans can only speak while exhaling.\n\nScientists recorded bull snake defensive noises in an acoustic chamber and analyzed their characteristics. They found that the snakes bellow usually during the first or second exhalation. The bellow is characterized by a high amplitude (louder-sounding) burst of sound followed by a longer period of low-amplitude (quieter) and constant-frequency sound that resembles a hiss.\n\nThe researchers found that bull snakes also hiss during their third or fourth exhalation, which resembles the second portion of the bellow in its low amplitude and constant frequency.\n\nPituophis snakes have a few unique anatomical features that help create these sounds. For one, these snakes are the only known animals to have a single vocal cord. Other animals have paired vocal cords made of smooth muscle tissue that vibrate and constrict to change the pitch of the sounds they make.\n\nWhereas human vocal cords are paired and vertically oriented, bull snakes and their relatives have a single cord that is oriented horizontally across the top portion of the larynx. The bellowing likely occurs when air flows over the tensed vocal cord, causing it to vibrate.\n\nThe scientists also found that another piece of tissue, called the epiglottal keel, had a minor role in the bellow. The keel is an oblong and stiff piece of tissue that sits in the path of the air flow and divides it like a boulder might split a river into two streams. When the snakes partially close their mouths, it’s like having a bigger boulder dividing a river that forces the water (or air with the snakes) down narrower paths. Having more air pass through partially obstructed paths amplifies the sound of the bellow’s initial burst.\n\nThe Potential\n\nStudying how snakes vocalize and amplify their sound could lead to devices that amplify sound through their structure, as opposed to through electronic means. Warning systems that alert people to natural disasters might one day use structural elements to efficiently carry sound further. Or perhaps they could lead to a revolution in hearing aid design."}, {"Source": "red harvester ant", "Application": "research in fastest spread", "Function1": "speed information flow", "Function2": "vary levels of connectivity.", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/individuals-share-information/", "Strategy": "Ant Colonies Speed Information Flow\n\nRed harvester ant colonies speed information flow by varying levels of connectivity.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvery day, as a matter of routine, ants around the world do something that humans find extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible: They carry out elaborate, coordinated activities, such as finding food and caring for offspring, without any single ant being in charge. Rather, the direction of their activities emerges from information-sharing interactions among the thousands of individuals comprising a colony. Through positive and negative feedback loops, those activities synergize and lead to a favorable outcome.\n\nIn many instances, the speed of information flow is critical to the quality of the outcome. For instance, if a marauding animal starts digging up a nest, the faster that the ants can communicate the need to move the young to safety, the more young will likely be saved. As a result, thanks to natural selection and evolution, it’s likely that the way information flows among ants has some built-in efficiencies that could offer insights for other systems. So, how do they do it?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nRed harvester ants, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, have some lessons to share. Native to the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, these seed-eaters adapt to unpredictable and widely varying food supplies through a fascinating division of labor. Early in the morning, patrollers set out from the bare-ground anthill to assess the availability of food. When they return, they touch antennae with foragers waiting in the chamber of the nest closest to the entrance. If they take too long to return, the forager ants don’t bother to go seed hunting but rather rely on their previously gathered underground stash to sustain them for the day. If the patrollers return quickly enough with food in jaw, foragers get the abundance message and set out to gather seeds.\n\nSimilarly, the rate at which foragers return and touch antennae with other foragers determines whether and how quickly additional foragers deploy. This system allows them to maximize the benefits of foraging and minimize the cost of spending time and energy on activities with little return for the colony.\n\nThis leads to the question: What’s the best way for the various categories of ants to communicate with each other to convey the messages to all involved as quickly as possible? Researchers studying the red harvester discovered that not every ant has an equal chance of being contacted by another ant. Rather, the path each ant takes and its location in the entrance to the anthill is correlated with interaction frequency. As a result, some ants end up becoming information hubs, interacting far more frequently than average with other ants. Feeding this pattern into a model, the researchers discovered that this “hub” strategy makes information flow faster than if the interactions among ants were more evenly distributed.\n\nThe Potential\n\nKnowing the fastest way to spread something through a network is extremely valuable in today’s connected world. This lesson already is being applied and has still more potential in realms such as speeding computing, improving emergency response, enhancing communication in an organization, or even helping control air traffic.

In engineering, such systems are mainly used for fixing connections, whereas an axle would be used for a simple rotation. The possible advantages and disadvantages of a screw-and-nut system over an axle in a leg joint may be most apparent at its end points. In ventral position, when fully tightened, the joint comes to a dead stop. One possible disadvantage, the danger of overwinding the thread, then is negligible, because the depressor muscles are already fully contracted at that point. We suggest that an advantage of this construction is that the leg comes to a stable resting position, preventing passive straining of leg muscles, which would not be accomplished by an axle construction. If the weevil’s leg is pulled in the opposite direction over its back, the muscles are torn off, and the trochanter can be neatly dislodged from the coxal nut. Such dislocation can be produced with the help of delicate forceps. Under natural circumstances, this is a highly unlikely event, because the beetle’s natural defensive reflex is to bring the legs into a ventral position if attacked by a predator.”  \n\n“As a rule, weevils are clumsier than many other beetles, e.g. carabidae.

For feeding, the thorn is pushed into the plant tissue, while the hind legs provide strong foothold.

Their skin is covered in bony scales called dermal denticles (literally ‘skin teeth’), generally 0.2-0.5 mm small, with fine regularly spaced (30–100 μm) longitudinal ridges aligned along the body axis. It has long been hypothesized that shark scales reduce drag by managing the water flow closest to the skin. In addition, shark denticles may help vortices (low-pressure regions of swirling water) stay attached to particular areas of the shark’s body, resulting in more suction and forward thrust. Thus, a shark’s denticles may increase swimming speeds by increasing thrust in addition to reducing drag.\n\nScale texture is just one of the factors that can influence shark skin hydrodynamics, however. Laboratory experiments have revealed that surfaces covered with shark skin, as well as synthetic replicas, experience faster swimming speeds (and presumably decreased drag) compared to surfaces with denticles removed. But this increase in speed only occurred when the textured surface was allowed to flex and bend (as a shark’s body would in the wild), and not when it was kept rigid.

One reason this increased stability arises is because genetically determined diversity in workers’ temperature response thresholds modulates the hive-ventilating behavior of individual workers, preventing excessive colony-level responses to temperature fluctuations.”"}, {"Source": "beaver dam", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "cleanse stream", "Function2": "reduce the speed of flow", "Function3": "improve water quality", "Function4": "filter out sediment", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/beaver-dams-cleanse-streams-by-slowing-water/", "Strategy": "Beaver Dams Cleanse Streams by Slowing Water\n\nObstacles placed in the path of sediment-laden water reduce the speed of flow, allowing debris from wildfires to settle out and improving water quality downstream.\n“Along with deterring the flames themselves, beaver dams and ponds also function as filters for ash and other fire-produced pollutants that enter waterways—thus maintaining water quality for fish, other aquatic animals, and humans—emerging evidence suggests.”\n\n“Beaver dams and ponds filter out sediment by slowing the rate at which water flows, says researcher Sarah Koenigsberg at the Beaver Coalition, an Oregon-based nonprofit organization that promotes conservation.

The most famous example of plant self-cleaning is the sacred lotus, which uses micro-scale bumps coated in tiny wax needles to form very stable air bubbles between droplets of water and the leaf surface. When the droplets roll off the surface, they pick up dirt and contaminating microbes and wash them away.\n\nFlowers are also often water-repellent (hydrophobic), however, their main function is to attract pollinators, and waxy surfaces like those on lotus leaves are slippery, making it more difficult for visiting insects to grip them. As flowers are short-lived organs and consequently contamination doesn’t matter as much, many flowers may have sacrificed self-cleaning for grip. Petals on flowers like roses have bumps similar to those found on lotus leaves, but they are covered with a smooth layer of wax instead of needles. This makes them less slippery, but also less repellent. Rose petals are still hydrophobic, enabling the flower to avoid becoming waterlogged, but water droplets stick to the petal surface instead of rolling off. As a result, contaminating particles are not washed away.\n\nPansy petals, on the other hand, do show self-cleaning properties comparable to those of lotus leaves, but they do so with a smooth wax coating like that of rose petals, ensuring that visiting pollinating insects are still able to grip them.\n\nPansy petals have unusually tall and pointed bumps on their surfaces that are 45 microns in height: nearly three times the height of similar bumps on rose petals. The bumps of both rose and pansy petals have a wrinkled surface. In roses, the wrinkles are wide enough that water can enter by capillary action, holding droplets in place and preventing them from rolling. But on pansy petals, the wrinkles are too narrow for water to enter. In addition, the tips of the bumps are smaller and closer together on pansy petals than they are for rose petals or lotus leaves. This keeps the total contact area between the petal and the water droplet small and prevents the air bubble from collapsing. The result is enhanced hydrophobicity and a self-cleaning surface that insects can still get a grip on."}, {"Source": "nematodes' anhydrobiosis", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "become desiccated", "Function2": "revive when moistened", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/anhydrobiosis-protects-during-desiccation/", "Strategy": "Anhydrobiosis Protects During Desiccation\n\nSome nematodes survive drought conditions by entering an ametabolic state known as anhydrobiosis.\n\n“Some nematodes, or round worms, undergo a similar, though less profound, form of cryptobiosis.

Most animals are born with basic linguistic abilities, but some animals can learn new ways to communicate as they grow. Understanding how animals learn and adapt their behavior can tell us a lot about the expanded roles communication can play in their lives.\n\nKiller whales (Orcinus orca) are very intelligent, highly social marine mammals that use clicks, pulses, and whistles to communicate with each other. These sounds vary slightly between pods and result in different ways of “speaking” called dialects. Similar to how English spoken in Boston might sound different from English spoken in Dallas, killer whale dialects function similarly, but each has its own flavor.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nHumans are now understanding more about how killer whales learn their vocal repertoire—and why. A study of killer whales held in captivity alongside bottlenose dolphins found that the killer whales changed their vocal patterns to more closely emulate the dolphins’ sounds. They used a higher proportion of clicks and whistles, similar to the dolphins, and fewer pulses. One killer whale even adopted a sound that was taught to a dolphin by humans, indicating they can learn and use sounds not found in the natural environment.\n\nThis ability to learn new communication sounds is called “vocal learning,” and it suggests killer whales can receive new information and adapt their linguistic behavior to best fit their environment. Effective communication is critical to building relationships, which is necessary in animals like killer whales who rely on social groups to hunt and move through the ecosystem.\n\nVocal learning illustrates that communication is not stagnant, but rather evolves based on environmental and social conditions. As killer whales in the wild face disruptive threats through ship traffic, oil drilling, marine debris, and climate change, the ability to change communication strategies to best fit a new social group could be a very important skill.\n\nThe Potential \n\nSince humans are also a highly social species, lessons from killer whales could be applied to our own approaches towards communication and learning. Their willingness and ability to adapt shows that when in a new social context, it may be valuable first to listen to how the group is already sharing information, then incorporate that style into your own communications.\n\nIt is also a model for thinking outside the box in terms of community and communication. While it is unclear what effect the adopted sounds have on the dolphins or their relationship with the killer whales, there are several possibilities: they could allow for the communication of detailed information, improve group cohesion, or they could go unnoticed by the dolphins. Doctor Doolittle jokes aside, what improvements in the safety of humans, livestock, and wildlife could be made if humans could better learn to adopt other species’ forms of communication?"}, {"Source": "african lion's claw", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protected from the wear", "Function2": "control claws", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/claws-protract-to-grip-prey/", "Strategy": "Claws Protract to Grip Prey\n\nClaws of the African lion protract from sheaths of skin to grab prey using muscles and tendons.\n\nThe African lion has a remarkable adaptation for hunting.

With this protraction mechanism, the claws are either passively retracted within the paw or actively extended out of the paw. In the paw’s relaxed state, elastic ligaments and tendons hold the claws within sheaths of skin. In this state, the claws are protected from the wear and tear that comes from walking on rough ground. Using this covering is like keeping a sword in its scabbard to protect it from becoming dull.

They excrete droplets of a liquid waste called honeydew. Excreted honeydew falls as a constant rain onto anything that happens to be underneath, including leaves and other leafhoppers that might be feeding from the same tree. Honeydew is very sticky and, for these tiny animals less than 8 mm long, becoming clogged up by it can be very dangerous.\n\nBrochosomes are tiny hollow football-shaped honeycomb spheres 400 nm across. Leafhoppers produce brochosomes from a special gland and then use a comb-like arrangement of setae, or hairs, on their legs to apply brochosomes across the whole surface of their bodies, including their eyes. Insect skin coated with brochosomes is superhydrophobic—meaning it is able to repel water as well as other water-based liquids like honeydew.\n\nMany animals and plants have solid surfaces that are water-repellent, but leafhopper brochosomes are a powder coating. This means they adhere to the surface of droplets that contact the insect and move with them as they roll off. Brochosomes also form a rough surface as they aggregate to different depths. This creates hierarchical surface roughness, which is one of the keys to water repellency.\n\nThe often intricate structures that make a surface water repellent are susceptible to damage. Structures that are built directly into the solid surface of an organism, like those of the sacred lotus plant and springtail skin, are difficult to repair. But because leafhoppers use a renewable coating of spheres, if anything removes the brochosomes, the coat can be quickly replaced. Furthermore, spheres are connected into branching chains. This means that, if spheres at one end of a chain are dislodged, those at the other end might stay attached to the animal. By repeatedly and vigorously grooming themselves, leafhoppers heal their water-repellent coat in a way that isn’t possible for organisms with permanent repellent surfaces."}, {"Source": "porcupine's quill", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "resistance to buckling", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/quills-resist-buckling/", "Strategy": "Quills Resist Buckling\n\nQuills of porcupines resist buckling because they are made of a dense outer shell surrounding an elastic, honeycomb-like core.\n\n“Thin walled cylindrical shell structures are widespread in nature: examples include porcupine quills, hedgehog spines and plant stems.

One species, Adansonia digitata, grows up to 25m tall and can reach a diameter of 10m. The Baobab’s large trunk size has long been thought of as a way to increase water storage, since the climate where they grow can have extended periods without rainfall. Studies examining trunk water usage during the dry season show conservative use of its stored water, as it has also been shown that drawing from the trunk water negatively affects the tree’s structural integrity. Moderate water use, however, is compensated for by its trunk geometry and outer bark.\n\nBaobab wood is characteristically soft and less dense than other types of wood, and the water content in the trunk is so high that the amount of solid wood in a given volume is as low as 5% in some species. The large amount of water within the inner wood directly affects the wood’s stiffness by affecting the cell turgor pressure, which is the pressure exerted by water inside a cell against the cell wall. The more water pushing against the cell wall, the greater the turgor pressure and the more rigid the cell becomes; with less water, the cell becomes flaccid. This in turn affects the overall stability of the tree, particularly the possibility of it buckling under the weight of its own mass during water shortages. Reported instances show that a large withdrawal of water has actually caused trees to collapse. In contrast, the water content of the thick outer bark remains constant throughout the year, which may help compensate for moderate use of water from the rest of the trunk.\n\nThe height of the Baobab tree and lack of material stiffness in its wood could cause the tree to collapse under its own weight, if it had a smaller trunk diameter similar to that of other trees. Instead, its large trunk compensates and allows the tree to grow to the same height and with the same resistance to buckling as other studied trees. Increasing trunk diameter directly increases its strength against buckling, which would cost more energy to construct for trees with denser wood. Testing of the baobab’s low-density wood has shown that the energy to construct such a large trunk is not more than other trees of the same height.

While these unusual characteristics and awkward shape could at first suggest Mola mola to be a planktonic fish with poor swimming capabilities, the ocean sunfish is able to move over considerable distances, both horizontally and vertically. This ability is directly related to the morphologic adaptations described above. The fish swims by stroking its dorsal and anal fins laterally and in a synchronous manner, thus generating a lift-based thrust that enables it to cruise at speeds of 04.-0.7 ms-1. This mode of swimming which resorts to fins that are not bilaterally symmetrical has not been found in other organisms so far. At the same time that it moves forward, the ocean sunfish is also able to undergo substantial vertical movements in the water column.

To stay in place for such a long time, most ticks secrete a cement like substance from their mouthparts after biting, but one species, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus doesn’t produce cement and it must hold on with physical force alone.

Birds, lizards and reptiles all lay eggs and the egg yolks contain everything necessary for an embryo to grow, including biotin. Biotin is also necessary for bacteria to grow, and so this makes egg yolk great food for bacteria and susceptible to infection.\n\nOne way of preventing bacterial growth is to make sure there’s no biotin available. To protect the yolk and the growing embryo, the white of eggs contains avidin, a biotin-binding protein that mops up any of the vitamin it comes into contact with. This makes the egg white a poor environment for bacterial growth and creates a physical protective barrier between the outside world and developing embryo.\n\nIt’s extremely important that, once it has been captured, biotin is not released back into the egg white. For this reason, the bond between avidin and biotin is one of the strongest and most stable known in nature. Although it is non-covalent and, technically, reversible, the bond is so strong that, in practice, it is permanent.\n\nSeveral factors make the avidin—biotin bond so strong. Avidin contains a very deep binding pocket that is shaped perfectly to fit biotin. Once the vitamin enters the pocket there are multiple interactions that hold it in place. Small electrical charges in biotin induce corresponding electrical charges in the lining of the binding pocket. Once these charges have been induced, they act like tiny magnets, gluing the biotin in place. At the same time, there are waxy patches on the walls of the pocket that match oily parts of the smaller molecule. In the same way that oil and water don’t mix, the oily patches cannot easily move past the induced charges and they also cement biotin in place.

Sucker-footed bats are an exception, as they roost head-up inside furled leaves by clinging to the walls of the leaf with pads on their wrists and ankles. It was originally thought that these bats attached to leaves using suction, but recent evidence has shown that they actually use wet adhesion to attach to leaf surfaces.\n\nWet adhesion is caused by several properties of water. The first, called “surface tension”, is what allows paperclips to be carefully rested on the surface a container of water, even though they are denser than water and sink if dropped into the liquid. Water molecules are attracted to each other by lots of weak bonds called “hydrogen bonds”. Water surrounded by other water molecules on all sides, for example in the middle of a volume, will be pulled equally in every direction. However, water on the surface, or boundary, has only a few neighbors, and so it binds more strongly to them, making molecules here harder to separate. Because of this, the water surface acts like a stretched elastic membrane, allowing paperclips to sit on top. Because water molecules bind to each other (“cohesion”), they can also be used to pull each other, as in siphoning. Finally, the stickiness of water also makes is adhere to surfaces (“adhesion”), and you can see this in the way it creeps up the side of a glass. In “capillary action”, adhesion to surfaces combines with surface tension to enable water to creep up narrow tubes, even against gravity. Wet adhesion is a combination of all of these properties of water working together.\n\nSucker-footed bats attach to leaves by releasing fluid onto their wrist and ankle pads. These pads are studded with ridges, which act as capillaries and help retain the fluid as it is released. When the pad comes in contact with the leaf, capillary action pulls the liquid out of the ridges and into the gap between the pad and the leaf surface, known as the boundary layer.

As animals cannot get energy from the sun, movement is crucial for finding food, as well as for reproducing: without muscles, we cannot survive.\n\nMuscles are complex tissues. Muscle cells are packed full of tiny cylinders of specialized contractile proteins. These cylinders, called sarcomeres, are arranged end to end into myofibrils. Muscle cells, or myofibers, contain many myofibrils. Inside a single muscle, there are multiple hierarchical levels of bundling: myofibrils are bundled into myofibers, then multiple myofibers are bundled into fascicles and then several fascicles are bundled together to form whole muscles. At each hierarchical level, each bundle is covered with a layer of connective tissue that supports the fibers inside it by supplying energy and oxygen via blood vessels and control via nerves.\nMuscle contraction occurs at the level of the individual sarcomeres. Although each tiny cylinder only contracts by a minuscule amount, once that contraction is repeated down the entire length of the myofibril and across every fibril, myofiber and fascicle all at once, muscles are able to contract by large amounts and generate relatively huge movements.\n\nIn order to transmit large movements to the skeleton, muscles must be attached to bones. In vertebrates, this attachment is via tendons. Muscles are capable of generating very large forces. For example, in humans, the masseter, or jaw muscle, is capable of generating a force of over 170 lbs at the molars. Remarkably, this force is transmitted entirely via vast numbers of weak non-covalent bonds between proteins that connect the sarcomeres inside muscle cells to the connective tissue outside.\n\nThere are a large number of proteins that are crucial for force transmission in muscles. Two of the most important are laminins, which are found in the connective tissue that coats each hierarchical bundle, and integrins, which are membrane-spanning proteins that connect indirectly to the sarcomeres themselves and transmit the force through the cell membrane to the laminins outside. These proteins are found along the length of all the muscle fibers as well as at the junction between the muscle and the tendon (the myotendinous junction). The spread of these force-transmitting proteins along the length of the myofibers ensures that, when sarcomeres contract, the force is spread evenly. In this way, the force at the myotendinous junction is transferred extremely efficiently."}, {"Source": "mole rat's lips", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "avoid dirt", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/lips-keep-soil-out-of-mouth/", "Strategy": "Lips Keep Soil Out of Mouth\n\nLips of the mole rat keep dirt out of their mouth while excavating by puckering closed behind the protruding front teeth.\n\n“Gnawing one’s way through earth could clearly be a distasteful business, but the mole-rat avoids mouthfuls of soil with a technique used by many other gnawers.

One grows into a tree up to thirty feet tall. Each of its branches ends in a dense rosette of large robust leaves. As the branches grow, so each year the lower ring of leaves in the rosette turn yellow and die. But they are not shed. Instead, they remain attached and form a thick lagging around the trunk. This is of crucial importance to the groundsel. The living leaves in the rosette contain special substances that prevent frost damage to the tissues and even though they may become covered by hoar frost during the night, they thaw out rapidly in the powerful warmth of the morning sun. But then the water within them starts to evaporate through their pores. If the liquid in the supply pipes running up through the trunk were to have frozen during the night, then the leaves would now be unable to replace their water and they would be baked dry and killed. The lagging of the dead leaves, however, prevents the pipes within the trunk from freezing and that particular danger is averted…The solution, however, generates another problem — this time a nutritional one.

However, birds show that they know how to use tools, mimic human speech, and even grieve their dead. Simply put, birds are intelligent. Yet, their brains are still used as a benchmark for stupidity. This mismatch is understandable because their brains look so different from our own.\n\nWhen people envision a mammal’s brain, they focus on the creased, gigantic structure known as the neocortex. It is the part of the brain that allows for creativity and flexible behavior and is even implicated in consciousness. Although birds do not have a neocortex, when scientists looked at the cellular organization of bird brains, they found a region called the dorsal ventricular ridge, or DVR, that shows neuronal connectivity similar to that in the neocortex of mammals.\n\nIn the mammalian structure, neurons are arranged into six layers of vertical columns which communicate with each other horizontally and vertically. This allows for more efficient and advanced mental processing. It was previously believed that the clumps of cells, called nuclei, that make up bird brains have less structure and organization than the layered mammalian cortex. However, it is now known that neurons within the DVR are arranged into layers and columns similar to mammalian brains. This suggests that the two regions may function similarly in both organisms.\n\nThe DVR boasts 0.5-2 billion neurons, which is significant when you compare it to the neocortices of other intelligent animals. Put simply, a greater number of neurons in the neocortex allows for better information processing. As a result, the number of neurons in the neocortex is the metric that humans use to claim their intellectual superiority over other animals. Humans have the most in the animal kingdom with approximately 16 billion neurons in their neocortices compared to 1-2 billion in advanced primates such as chimpanzees. The bird DVR, therefore, is on par with some of the most developed neocortices known.\n\nThis finding explains how birds can perform such advanced behaviors, proving that appearances can be misleading. The finding that the DVR has a similar structure to the mammalian neocortex, even while looking different to the naked eye, gives us a clearer view of the diversity of intelligence in the animal kingdom.

The specific hydrocarbon structures and relative abundances thereof are unique to each colony (due to shared diet) and act as a shared chemical fingerprint for nest-mates. Ants detect the hydrocarbon signature of other ants using their antennae and use it to determine if they are friends or foes. Instead of both checking for the presence of friendly-type hydrocarbons and checking for the presence of foreign-type hydrocarbons, the ants simply respond to chemical signatures that contain new elements not previously habituated to. In other words, they do not identify nest-mates; they only identify non-nest-mates. Since nest-mates consume the same specific diet and share food with each other, they develop the same cuticular hydrocarbon fingerprint.\nIn a simple form of learning, the antennal lobes become desensitized by near-constant exposure to nest-mate fingerprints and response to it is reduced. However, the reception of a signature that contains additional compounds not previously habituated to (e.g., that of a non-nest-mate) initiates the olfactory receptor response fully and causes aggresive behavior. This mechanism explains why insects with practically no hydrocarbon fingerprint (i.e., certain colony parasites and young workers) do not elicit a response in guard ants. To put it simply, carpenter ants don’t distinguish nest-mates by comparing fingerprint similarity, they do so instead by determining whether or not a fingerprint fits within the pattern of the habituated signature. The neurological basis is perhaps best understood by human analogy. When constantly exposed to an odor, one becomes accustomed to it and may not be able to detect its presence. Nonetheless, even after being habituated to that specific odor, it is possible to notice the presence of a new one."}, {"Source": "coral's exoskeletons", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "strong uvr absorbance", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/exoskeleton-absorbs-uv-light/", "Strategy": "Exoskeleton Absorbs UV Light\n\nThe calcium carbonate exoskeletons of corals may help protect their photosynthetic symbionts by absorbing UV rays.\n\n“Many coral reef organisms are photosynthetic or have evolved in tight symbiosis with photosynthetic symbionts.

They wield these weapons to eat and not be eaten in the dark depths.\n\nThere are more than 200 species of anglerfish. Most are dark gray or brown and less than 1 foot (30 centimeters) long, though the largest can reach 40 inches (100 centimeters). They have huge heads and mammoth mouths filled with sharp, translucent fangs. They dwell far below the surface of the ocean, where sunlight no longer penetrates and the ocean fades to black. Here, female anglerfish have evolved body features to manipulate light—to lure prey with it and simultaneously to avoid illuminating themselves and becoming prey.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nIn the vast, dark, open spaces of the ocean, bacteria, tiny zooplankton, shrimp and other crustaceans, jellies and other gelatinous animals, and many fish produce and emit their own light. They use this bioluminescence to attract mates, communicate with kin, or blend in with light flowing down from the surface. But every time a creature lights up, it risks being seen by predators.\n\nA female anglerfish works both ends of this paradox, using two remarkable adaptations. Instead of expending energy to search for food, she coaxes food to unwittingly come to her.\\n\\nThe first adaptation is a long, movable spine sticking out of the top of her head. At the tip of the spine hangs a fleshy sac called an esca. Inside the esca, bioluminescent bacteria settle in to live. They emit light in blue wavelengths that aren’t absorbed by water. The bacteria gain a protected place to live. The anglerfish gets a glowing orb to attract prey. The spine is her fishing rod; the glowing esca is her bait.\n\nAn anglerfish dangles her spine just above her cavernous mouth to mimic the movements of smaller, glowing organisms. She keeps the rest of her body still and hovering. That’s when she makes use of the second key adaptation: her skin.\n\nThe Potential \n\nScientists have taken a lesson from anglerfish, exploring ways to harness bioluminescent light. Applications range from glowing biochemical “tags” used in medicine and scientific research to new bioinspired lamps and the development of bioluminescent trees that could replace streetlights.\n\nResearchers are also investigating the properties of ultra-black skins to explore new ways to make light-absorbing materials for solar panels, telescopes, and camouflaging textiles."}, {"Source": "bacillus bacteria's xylanase", "Application": "biological de-bleaching processes", "Function1": "break down plant cell walls", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/enzymes-help-break-down-plant-cell-walls/", "Strategy": "Enzymes Help Break Down Plant Cell Walls\n\nXylanase enzymes of Bacillus bacteria enable breakdown of plant cell walls without breaking down cellulose.\n\n“The term “alkaliphile” is used for microorganisms that grow optimally or very well at pH values above 9 but cannot grow or grow only slowly at the near-neutral pH value of 6.5…The cell surface may play a key role in keeping the intracellular pH value in the range between 7 and 8.5, allowing alkaliphiles to thrive in alkaline environments, although adaptation mechanisms have not yet been clarified. Alkaliphiles have made a great impact in industrial applications.

The current proportion of total world enzyme production destined for the laundry detergent market exceeds 60%. Another important application is the industrial production of cyclodextrin by alkaline cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase.

Biology also employs polymers (especially proteins and polysaccharides) to perform mechanical functions and there are several examples in which biology covalently crosslinks polymers to confer elasticity and strength. In some cases, the crosslinking enzymes have attracted attention as a simple and safe means for macromolecular processing in vitro. Here, we review recent research with two enzymes, tyrosinase and microbial transglutaminase, that are being examined for a variety of applications.” \n\n“Prof. [Herb] Waite’s work on mussel adhesion has demonstrated that biology offers many important lessons for materials scientists. Biology’s crosslinking enzymes may enable us to apply two such lessons. The first lesson is sustainability. Enzymes enable renewable, bio-based raw materials to be accessed to generate functional materials. We are using various natural phenols, proteins, and polysaccharides to create functional polymers and crosslinked networks. In addition to the renewable raw materials, the enzyme-catalyzed processes are expected to be inherently safe and the products environmentally-friendly (e.g., biodegradable). The second lesson is bottom-up precision assembly. A current challenge in nanotechnology is the hierarchical assembly of pre-formed nanoparticles into precise assemblies for either drug delivery or nanoelectronics. Nature is well known for its ability to employ non-covalent mechanisms (e.g., hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions), molecular recognition, and self-assembly to precisely construct macromolecular assemblies from their component parts. Enzymes are capable of selectively adding covalent bonds which could stabilize macromolecular assemblies and, thus, complement self-assembly methods based on reversible physical mechanisms. As we learn these lessons, we expect a growth in the list of examples in which biology’s crosslinking enzymes are explored for technological applications.”"}, {"Source": "cyanobacteria's micro-compartment", "Application": "converting carbon dioxide", "Function1": "convert co2", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/micro-compartment-converts-carbon-dioxide/", "Strategy": "Micro‑compartment Converts Carbon Dioxide\n\nCarbonic anhydrases in cyanobacteria interconvert CO2 and bicarbonate by entrapping proteins in confined micro-compartment.\nWith global warming becoming such a prevalent issue in the world, research concerning the conversion of carbon dioxide is a hot topic. Researchers have recently studied the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate in cyanobacteria. In the cells of these bacteria there are micro-compartments (carboxysomes) that contain a large amount of proteins (i.e., enzymes). Two particular proteins, rubisco and carbonic anhydrase (CA), catalyze (or induce/speed up the process) the conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate. When carbon dioxide enters the cell, the enzyme rubisco fixes the molecule to a sugar (ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate) which causes the formation of two new molecules (please see illustration below for diagram of process). Without the presence of CAs, this fixation process is tedious and much slower. However, large amounts of CAs can increase the reaction rate 1000-fold, thus yielding a much greater amount of CO2 to be fixed by rubisco.

Polyspermy is the fusion of more than one sperm with a single ovum. When this happens, there are extra copies of all the chromosomes in the cell and the fertilized egg is usually not viable.

Without some sort of protection against such microorganisms, thousands of tons of fruits and vegetables would spoil and go to waste before they even made it to our grocery stores. Oregano has emerged as a source of potent plant-protection molecules, producing oils and vapors that prevent fungal infection and food spoilage.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nAs it turns out, oregano and a number of other plants (eucalyptus, rosemary, thyme) have built-in defense mechanisms to fight off fungal attacks. These are usually in the form of messenger molecules present in the plant’s fluids that easily evaporate into the surrounding air. If one plant is attacked by a fungus, it will release these “volatile organic compounds” to alert surrounding plants; the reception of the VOCs will then initiate the surrounding plants’ natural defense responses.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThere is keen interest in using VOCs from oregano commercially for food preservation. In previous decades, synthetic fungicides have been used to prevent food spoilage.  However, these synthetic compounds do not degrade easily in soil and groundwater, and can be toxic to a broad range of organisms.  Furthermore, fungi can develop resistance to synthetic fungicides, requiring even more of the chemicals to be applied to be effective, which in turn worsens environmental impacts.  Essential oils extracted from plants, on the other hand, are much less harmful, since they do not remain in soil or water for long, and very low amounts are needed to be effective.\n\nSeveral companies are now working on integrating plant-derived VOCs into food packaging, as an alternative to artificial preservatives.

The stems, leaves, and any flowers sit above the soil where the leaves photosynthesize. Below the soil surface the plants’ roots and some important partners are also working hard. The roots help anchor the plants and take in water and nutrients from the soil. The roots also support a large variety of bacteria, including ones that live inside plants’ cells and others that live in the spaces in between the cells. Another group of bacteria called rhizobacteria live outside the plant nestled among the roots. This area is known as the rhizosphere.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nRhizobacteria and plants work together to help each other survive. This is called a mutualistic relationship. The plant gives the bacteria a place to live and provides them with nutrients through its roots. In return, bacteria take natural chemicals in the soil such as nitrogen and turn them into more useful kinds of chemicals such as ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites. Some chemicals the bacteria produce increase the size and surface area of roots so they have more contact with the soil.

Bacteria resistant to HgCH3+ toxicity produce an enzyme named MerB, which has three cysteine residues in its active site that are known to be crucial for cleaving the Hg-C bond. But the exact way in which MerB coordinates to HgCH3+ and the ‘intimate details of the reaction mechanism’ have been a mystery, Parkin says. (A second enzyme, MerA, reduces the resulting Hg2+ to less toxic elemental mercury.) Melnick and Parkin thus set out to decipher the mechanism of action of MerB. Melnick and Parkin ‘provide an elegant atomic-level description for the facile cleavage of a carbon-mercury bond,’ notes James G. Omichinski of the University of Montreal in a Science commentary. Their observations provide valuable insight into the basic mechanism of MerB’s activity, he adds. Considerable work remains to be done, but understanding this mechanism ‘is essential to efforts to reengineer MerB to improve its catalytic efficiency for the bioremediation of methylmercury,’ Omichinski writes.” "}, {"Source": "multicolor gill polypores and other brown rot fungi", "Application": "digestive enzymes", "Function1": "break down cellulose", "Function2": "break down toxins and complex chemicals", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/enzymes-break-down-cellulose-toxins/", "Strategy": "Enzymes Break Down Cellulose, Toxins\n\nMulticolor gill polypores and other brown rot fungi break down cellulose and some toxins using digestive enzymes.\n\n“The powerful enzymes secreted by certain fungi digest lignin and cellulose, the primary structural components of wood.

They are difficult to artificially synthesize in quantity because the epoxide opening reactions that theoretically produce them tend to favor the formation of small, five-membered rings rather than the desired six-membered rings. To overcome this problem, chemists bond “directing-groups” to each and every epoxide unit which then must be removed by later reactions in many cases. This process creates low yields of ladder polyethers, generates relatively large amounts of chemical waste, and requires toxic solvents and chemicals. The dinoflagellate Karenia brevis produce large quantities of ladder polyethers called brevetoxins which produce the notorius marine die-offs associated with red tide blooms. It does so using water-based cascade reactions. It is likely that K. brevisfirst synthesizes template epoxy alchohols which then direct the formation of the desired six-member ring constituents of the ladder. An epoxide opening cascade reaction results, in which more six-member rings are added to the nascent ladder; the rate of the reaction is not affected by the number of rings already bound in the ladder.

Certain changes in DNA can result in changes to a bacteria that make it resistant to an antibiotic, and this makes the antibiotic less effective at killing the bacteria.\n\nAnother way bacteria can protect themselves from antibiotics is to form a ‘biofilm’. A biofilm is a substance produced by bacteria that covers them and protects them from harm. Biofilms are the source of more than 60% of bacteria-causing diseases. For example, slimy films in swamps are biofilms. Forming biofilms is a social strategy that helps to protect bacteria. It can physically prevent antibiotics and disinfectants from coming close to the cell. It also protects the cell from removal by physical means, such as wiping or washing away on surfaces.\n\nAlthough biofilms are very useful, bacteria need to use energy and resources to grow them. Bacteria expel different substances to build and maintain the biofilm. A group of bacteria working together is called a colony. The colony needs all the cells to work together to grow and maintain the biofilm. Creating biofilms can benefit any cell underneath the film, even if some bacteria don’t produce the necessary substances. To visualize this, imagine a community of 50 people holding up a blanket to protect themselves. The blanket needs to be held up to be useful. Of the 50, 10 people may not be holding up the blanket but they will still be protected. However, if only 1 person is holding up the blanket then it will fail to protect everyone.\n\nThis strategy helps to strengthen the bacterial community as a whole. For it to work, a majority of the colony is expected to take part. Because there is a cost in energy and resources to produce the biofilm, if certain bacteria are not making the substances they can grow faster than those that are. Eventually, these bacteria will outnumber those putting energy into making the biofilm. Over time, there will be less bacteria contributing to making the biofilm and it won’t be as good at protecting all the bacteria. This makes them more vulnerable to antibiotics or being removed from surfaces.\n\nScientists are studying how bacteria make biofilms to help develop more effective antibiotics. They have developed a chemical (5-aryl-2-aminoimidazole-based inhibitor) that can stop bacteria from making biofilms. This makes it easier to kill the bacteria with antibiotics and makes it easier to remove them from surfaces."}, {"Source": "obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (ohcb)", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "degrade petroleum hydrocarbons", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bacteria-degrade-petroleum-hydrocarbons/", "Strategy": "Bacteria Degrade Petroleum Hydrocarbons\n\nBlooms of obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria (OHCB) result in the rapid degradation of many oil constituents.\n“Despite these qualifications about experimental approaches, it is clear that oil hydrocarbon degradation in marine systems is carried out by microorganisms belonging to a relatively small group of genera.” "}, {"Source": "bamboo stem's fiber", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "use material efficiently", "Function2": "optimize material use", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fiber-arrangement-is-highly-efficient/", "Strategy": "Fiber Arrangement Is Highly Efficient\n\nFibers in stems of bamboo use materials efficiently because of their arrangement\n\nBamboo is a strong and flexible composite.

For Eucalyptus kochii plenissima, however, this is not the case. Due to a special root adaption called a lignotuber, absent in most other plants, this species can regenerate after the aboveground part is destroyed.\n\nA lignotuber is a special swelling at the top of the plant’s root system (which sits mostly submerged below ground). It contains starch, sugars, nutrients, and “meristematic foci” (read on for more about this). These contents enable the plant to regrow its shoots.

Dig a little deeper and you’ll see that woven through just a single shovel-full are literally miles of fibers created when fungi break down plant material to make tissue for themselves. The fibers, collectively known as mycelium, reach far and wide to harvest food for the fungi.\n\nIn the process, they create a physical network with remarkable mechanical properties. Organic, lightweight, durable, and moldable, mycelium not only offers inspiration for the design of manufactured materials, but also can be used directly to make a wide range of objects with desirable traits.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nFungi grow from spores just as plants grow from seeds. When a spore sprouts, it puts out a microscopic rootlike structure called a hypha. As it grows, the hypha branches, eventually creating a network of tube-shaped threads called mycelium that can stretch for miles underground, fusing with other hyphae to create a dense web.\n\nEach thread consists of several types of chemicals. On the inside are proteins and chitin fibers held together with sugars that provide mechanical rigidity and strength. On the outside, beta-glucans form a gel-like material that give flexibility and expandability. In which direction the fibers grow and how dense the network becomes depends on the physical and chemical traits of the environment as well as the food available within it.\n\nThe combination of the materials that make up individual hyphae and the structure of the mycelium as a whole, composed of both fibers and the spaces between them, give the overall material some highly desirable traits. It is at the same time strong and flexible. It can be compressed and bounce back. It slows the spread of heat and sound. And because the shape of the space and amount of food available influence the degree and direction the hyphae grow, a mycelium mat can take a variety of shapes and density characteristics.\n\nThe Potential \n\nMycelium provides inspiration for making lightweight containers, construction panels, furniture, clothing, and other objects with a wide range of beneficial traits such as padding, durability, thermal insulation, soundproofing, and the ability to wick moisture.\n\nIn addition to serving as a source of inspiration, mycelium can be produced and used as a raw material itself. Because it is organic, mycelium made by fungi offers additional benefits. It can be produced from waste materials. It is biodegradable. And when it burns it doesn’t produce harmful gases as do plastics and other manmade materials.\n\n"}, {"Source": "paper wasp's nest", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "create paper-like material", "Function2": "hardening saliva", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nests-made-of-paper/", "Strategy": "Nests Made of Paper\n\nNests of paper wasps are made of paper-like material, created from wood and hardening saliva.\n\n“Three animals, for instance, have independently invented the making of paper.

Both the larvacean and its home are delicate and transparent––the larvacean shaped like a tadpole and its mucus house a beautiful, jellyfish-like floating structure surrounding the larvacean’s body. In addition to protecting the larvacean, its house serves to collect and filter its food. Houses can outsize their larvaceans by quite a bit, with some measuring more than 39 inches (1 meter) across.

Just how the giant larvaceans are able to build their houses so quickly remains a mystery.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe food filter, built using transparent structural proteins combined with cellulose, is located within the interior section of the house. Water flows from the outer section of the house into this section through two entry points––filtered as it enters––and then reaches the chamber where the larvacean lives. The larvacean beats its tail to direct the water towards either another filter that concentrates food of the right size or into a garbage chute that dumps food that’s not the right size into the outer section of the house. From the second filter, the food that is just right makes its way directly into the larvacean’s mouth.

However, resistance to fracture is linked to flexibility, meaning these two properties are in conflict with each other: stiff and hard materials are prone to cracking, while those that don’t crack tend to be weaker and prone to bending. Composite materials achieve improved performance, usually by embedding a strong and stiff material in a matrix of a softer and more flexible one to combine the best properties of both.\n\nWood is a trusted composite that humans have used for building for millennia. Wood is a composite of cellulose fibers embedded in a matrix, but its performance is better than models suggest it should be based on its composition alone: the arrangement of the fibers matters. In trees, hollow tubes (which double as transport vessels) are reinforced with spiral-wrapped bundles of cellulose fibers. Wood is hierarchical and bundles of vessels form concentric layers that contribute to strength and stiffness. Because the fibers are helically wound, they do not easily snap or pull out of the matrix—the two main ways in which fiber composites commonly fail. Instead, fibers must unwind as they are pulled out and broken, increasing the energy required to fracture wood.\n\nBamboo is a woody grass with material properties comparable with steel, which it is often used in place of. Like wood, bamboo is a cellulose composite with helically-wound fibers wrapped around hollow vessel bundles. However, the structure of vessels in bamboo is more complex. In bamboo, vessels are wrapped in a series of concentric layers of cellulose fibers that alternate between thick layers of fibers wound in one direction (at an angle of about 45° to the vertical) and thin layers wound in the opposite direction (at an angle of around 5° to the vertical). When a plant bends, one side of the stem, and of each vascular bundle, is compressed, while the opposite side stretches. When the cellulose fibers are compressed they can bulge and buckle, leading to failure of the material. The inclusion of thin, oppositely-coiled cellulose layers restrain the main load-bearing thick layers, preventing them from bulging and giving bamboo its impressive performance.\n\nWhen they do break, both wood and bamboo absorb a lot of the energy and broken stems often remain attached, meaning failure is safer than in other materials."}, {"Source": "greta oto caterpillar's silk pad and cremaster", "Application": "super hook-and-loop fastener", "Function1": "form strong attachment", "Function2": "prevent sliding off", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/larval-hooks-hold-on-tight/", "Strategy": "Larval Hooks Hold on Tight\n\nHooks and silk of butterfly larvae form a strong attachment under leaves\n\nMost insects go through complete metamorphosis, where their body pattern alters from one form to a new one. The change occurs inside a hard casing, called a pupa, and is a complete remodeling of their entire bodies. During metamorphosis, the body of the lava breaks down completely into a sort of cellular soup that then reforms into an entirely new shape. During this process, the insect is unable to defend itself and is very vulnerable. Butterflies and moths have a number of ways of hiding their pupae, including mimicking leaves and other plant parts so as to be less obvious to predators. One species, the Greta oto, or glass-winged butterfly adds to the protection from camouflage by suspending itself from the underside of leaves when pupating.\n\nGreta oto caterpillars weave a silken pad that is glued to the underside of the leaf. The silk fibers in the pad are deliberately tangled as they are spun to create large numbers of tiny loops. Once the pad has been spun, the animal inserts a specialized array of hooks, called a cremaster, into the silk pad. The cremaster is made of tough chitin that will not snap and it becomes a permanent part of the case of the pupa as the insect inside metamorphoses into the adult butterfly.\n\nThe hooks of the cremaster are highly specialized for hanging securely from the silk pad. The hooks are arrayed over the surface of the cremaster in a ball shape, which makes it easier for the hooks to penetrate the center of the pad without squashing it, whilst also increasing the available hooked surface area.\n\nThe hooks themselves are also highly specialized. Each hook ends with a backward facing barb that ensures that, while the threads of the silk can slip easily over the end of the hook, it cannot so easily slide off. Each barb is split into segments, forming mini barbs with a groove in between. Silk fibers can also sit in these grooves, forming a further barrier that prevents the hooked loops from sliding off.\n\nThe silk pad and cremaster of the Greta oto creates a sort of super hook-and-loop fastener that is at least 50 times stronger than is necessary to support the weight of the chrysalis. It is likely the extra strength is to protect the animal from the extra stresses caused by swaying caused by the strong winds that are common in its native habitat."}, {"Source": "orb weaving spider web", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "stretch and rebound", "Function2": "reform hydrogen bonds", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/spider-web-is-strong-and-elastic/", "Strategy": "Spider Web Is Strong and Elastic\n\nWebs of orb spiders are elastic and strong because of sacrificial bonds that break and then reform\n\nSpider capture silk is the silk used to form the spiral in webs built by orb weaver spiders.

Far from being a loose sac of water and chemicals, as they are often envisaged, cells are actually densely packed with structures and organelles, all constantly carrying out crucial functions. While a lot of these functions are regulated by the passive diffusion of signaling molecules, many of them require active transport. Microtubules make up the physical skeleton of cells, enabling them to move and change shape, and they also form part of the infrastructure along which cellular components are transported. Microtubules also transport chromosomes, and so are critical for cell division and replication.\n\nMicrotubules are formed from numerous copies of the protein tubulin. Loose tubulin in the cytoplasm binds to molecules of GTP and becomes activated. In its active form, individual tubulin proteins will attach to one end of a growing microtubule. However, tubulin breaks down (hydrolyzes) GTP to GDP and GDP-bound tubulin is much more likely to dissociate from a microtubule. This reaction does not occur immediately, and there is a delay between tubulin becoming bound to GTP and its hydrolyzation to GDP. Because GDP-bound tubulin cannot pop out of the side of a microtubule in which it is already incorporated and only dissociates from one end, as long as new tubulin is being added to the end of a microtubule at a faster rate than hydrolyzation is occurring, there will be a cap of GTP-bound tubulin that will prevent the microtubule falling apart. However, if the rate of new tubulin addition slows and the protein at the tip hydrolyzes its GTP to GDP, this protective cap is lost and the microtubule will begin to fray. This sudden switch from growing to shrinking is called a microtubule “catastrophe” and is an important part of regulating tube length. Once a cap of GTP-bound tubulin reforms, the microtubule begins to grow again, termed “rescue”.\n\nThe precise mechanisms regulating microtubule catastrophe are not yet known, although it is understood to be regulated by multiple different factors. Catastrophe occurs at a higher rate in longer microtubules, indicating there must be a multi-step process that protects shorter microtubules from undergoing frequent catastrophe and enables them to grow.\n\nTo see how microtubule catastrophe works, check out this video.\n\n"}, {"Source": "apostle bird's mud nest", "Application": "vibration firms mud nest", "Function1": "vibrate mud", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/vibration-firms-mud-nest-2/", "Strategy": "Vibration Firms Mud Nest\n\nThe mud nest of the apostle bird is a sturdy home high in the trees, built using a jiggled-mud construction technique.\n\nApostlebirds, which are native to the woodlands of Australia, build large nests that can have walls up to 2.54 cm (1 in.) thick, weigh up to 2.3 kg (5 lb.), and be located as high as 15 m (50 ft.) above the ground.

But given that bees have brains the size of grains of sand, how do they make hexagonal hives with such geometric precision?\n\nThe Strategy \n\nTo begin with, bees excrete wax through four pairs of glands underneath their abdomens. They chew and knead the wax to shape it, but they also use heat. In 2004, Dr. Christian Pirk, entomologist at the University of Pretoria, found that inside a hive where bees were building, wax measured 15 °F (8 °C) warmer than areas with no active construction.\n\nTo create this rise in temperature, bees decouple their flying muscles from their wings and vibrate the muscles to generate heat. They heat the wax to temperatures over 100 °F (38 °C), lowering its viscosity, and making it easier to mold.\n\nHowever, bees don’t sculpt six neatly-shaped walls. Pirk found this out when he interrupted the building bees by smoking them out of the hive. He took resin casts of the tubes and discovered that the warmer, fresher cells were actually round cylinders while older, cooler cells formed the expected hexagonal prisms. Somehow, as the cylinders cool, they transform into hexagons.\n\nTo understand this, consider an analogous phenomenon associated with soap bubbles. When two spherical bubbles meet, they join at a flat wall. When a third bubble is added, two additional walls form so that one wall separates each pair of bubbles. The three walls quickly rearrange themselves into a kind of Y-shape with three equal 120-degree angles. According to Joseph Plateau, the Belgian physicist who discovered surface tension, bubble walls seek 120 degrees because, at this angle, the wall surface tensions are all in balance. Now a series of 120-degree angles eventually closes on itself, forming a perfect hexagon. So as more bubbles are added, and more walls balance into 120-degree angles, the array of separate bubbles becomes a tightly packed grid of hexagons.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe hexagonal shape arises without any constructive action from the bees. Instead, the cooling wax follows a universal tendency of physical forces to seek equilibrium.

His essay, “The Philosophy of Birds’ Nests,” kicked off a 150-year-long debate about whether or not birds build nests due purely to instinct—or as Wallace put it, “without teaching or experience.”\n\nIn April of 2020, Dr. Alexis Breen, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, authored a study that she says provides “another big support for knocking down the myth that nest-building is all in the genes.” Many incorrectly assume that birds model their first nests after those they hatched into. Breen’s research indicates that if juveniles interact socially with adult zebra finches, it influences the way the young finches construct their first nests when they reach sexual maturity—both in terms of the materials they choose and how quickly they build.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nWhy do speed and construction materials matter so much? Building a nest is key to their ability to reproduce. “For many birds, they really get one shot, maybe two, at building a nest,” Breen said. She added that evidence in other bird species links rapid nest-making to breeding success and prosperity later in life. In other words, building a good nest quickly might just be a matter of life and death for the next generation.\n\nThe Potential \n\nBreen said that understanding the learning and cultural processes that zebra finches use to build nests may help us understand how other animals come to use tools and technology and may even provide clues into our own evolution.\nWhile Wallace may have been right that instinct doesn’t dictate how birds build nests, it appears he was mistaken about what he thought mattered most—imitation. Breen’s results demonstrate that the mere presence of an adult was more important than the experience gained either through handling material themselves or from watching adults use it. She said that result went against the assumption that birds need a lot of demonstration to use tools. “It looks like if they need some, they don’t need much.”"}, {"Source": "false vampire bat's nose leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "aid echolocation", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nose-structure-aids-echolocation/", "Strategy": "Nose Structure Aids Echolocation\n\nThe nose leaf of false vampire bats may be used in echolocation, though its role is not well understood.\n“[The false vampire bat’s] prominent nose leaf, a fold of skin standing up over its nose, is also involved in direction-finding, but its role is not understood.” "}, {"Source": "biofilm colony of bacillus subtilis", "Application": "air and water repellant surface", "Function1": "water and gas repellant", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/air-and-water-repellant-surface-prevents-entry-of-fluids/", "Strategy": "Air and Water Repellant Surface\nPrevents Entry of Fluids\n\nBiofilm colonies of Bacillus subtilis are highly water and gas repellant due to a combination of chemical composition and nano-scale topography.\nBiofilms are colonies of bacteria that form on virtually any surface.

Unlike underground species, the South American grass-cutting ant builds a thatched nest on the surface of the ground. A thatched nest is a mound structure formed from plant fragments and debris. This structure has a single central chamber where the ants cultivate fungi to feed their young (the brood). The ants must effectively regulate temperature and humidity within the thatched nest to provide ideal conditions for the fungus and brood. This is possible with the help of a thatched nest structure and the ants’ building behavior.\n\nIn the long term, the thatched nest provides a good amount of insulation. This is because the thatch material, compared to soil and the environment, reacts less quickly to changes in temperature. This limits the amount of heat that flows through the structure. Limited heat flow prevents the nest from overheating during the day and prevents major heat loss at night. The ants even place a five to ten centimeter layer of regurgitated grass fragments (called mulch) on the ground to limit the heat exchange between the fungus and the underlying soil. The nest’s insulation effectively entraps the internal heat generated by the ants and the fungi, enabling the fungus garden to remain five degrees Celsius above the average soil temperatures in all seasons. This is essential for favorable growth of the fungus and the brood, which prefer an optimal temperature of 24.1 degrees Celsius and high humidity.\n\nIn the short term, the South American grass-cutting ants display building behaviors to maintain the internal nest climate. As the nest reaches a temperature that might be harmful to the fungus or the brood, the ants create numerous openings in the thatched structure to allow the cooler air in from the outside to reduce the heat. However, the ants also show a response to any humid air leaving the nest by depositing material to close and seal openings. The colony constantly makes trade-offs between these two actions to locally control temperature and humidity shifts. Furthermore, these ants were found to deconstruct clusters or piles of material and relocate the items to allow for thatch turnover. This constant shifting of the thatch improves the insulation by moving the humid organic material (which has less insulation) from the inside of the nest to the outside, where it can dry more quickly. It also loosens the structure to provide better nest ventilation.\n\nThe nest of the South American grass-cutting ant is able to thrive due to the temperature and humidity control provided by its thatched structure and the active participation of the ants. The adaptations of this species have ultimately enabled it to extend its distribution range more in southern temperate regions compared to other subterranean species.\n\nThis summary was contributed by Leon Wang and Jack Mevorah."}, {"Source": "pollen grains", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "generate geometric patterns", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/patterns-in-pollen-grains-form-without-using-energy/", "Strategy": "Patterns in Pollen Grains Form Without Using Energy\n\nPatterns on the surface of pollen grains form without using energy\n\nBeautifully crafted architecture isn’t limited to human-made structures. Nature is rife with ornate structures, from the spiraling fractal patterns of seashells to the intricately woven array of neurons in the brain.\n\nThe microscopic world contains its fair share of intricate patterns and designs, such as the geometric patterns on individual grains of pollen. Scientists have been fascinated by these intricate structures, which are smaller than the width of a human hair, but have yet to determine how these patterns form and why they look the way they do.\n\nIt was originally thought that pollen spheres are formed by a ‘buckling’ mechanism. Buckling occurs when materials are strong on the outside but pliable on the inside, causing the structure to shrink inwards and form divots, or “buckles,” on the surface.\n\nHowever, it is now believed that pollen patterns occur by a process known as phase separation, which physicists have found can also generate geometric patterns in other systems. An everyday example of phase separation is the separation of cream from milk; when milk sits at room temperature, cream rises to the top naturally without any additional energy, like mixing or shaking.\n\nThis “default” tendency of developing pollen spores to undergo a phase separation then leads to detailed and concave patterns. However, if plants pause this natural pattern-formation process by secreting a stiff polymer that prevents phase separation, for example, they can control the shapes that form. These plants tend to have pollen spores that are smoother and more spherical. Surprisingly, the smooth pollen grains, which require additional energy, occur more frequently than ornate grains, suggesting that smooth grains may provide an evolutionary advantage.\n\nThis biophysical framework will now enable researchers to study a much larger class of biological materials, and see if the same rules can explain much more intricate architectures in biology, like the bristles of insects or the cell walls of plants.\n"}, {"Source": "glass sponge's cells", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "release silica", "Function2": "produce silica rod", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/silica-structure-self-assembles/", "Strategy": "Silica Structure Self‑assembles\n\nCell clusters associated with the surface of the giant basal growing spicule of the glass sponge release silica for controlled circumferential growth.\n\nMonorhaphis chuni sponges have evolved the genes to synthesize giant basal spicule that are nearly 3 meters long.

Once the web has been made, spiders walk slowly and carefully across it ensuring they only touch structural strands, which are not coated with glue. While they are building their webs, however, they have to touch the sticky strands to attach them to the scaffold. The glue is non-specific and strong, so how are spiders able to construct their webs without getting stuck?\n\nOrb weaver spiders’ legs are coated with hair-like structures called “setae”, which all point down towards the end of the leg. When a spider pushes down on a sticky strand, it doesn’t push down directly onto the strand, but past it, so the web strand slides along the surface of the leg. As it does this, the web line becomes snagged on the hairs, enabling the spider to direct the glue-coated silk down and force it to adhere to the structural strands. The hairs are branched, which stops strands from sliding all the way to the base of the hair, where they might contact the spider’s leg and become stuck.\n\nWhen the spider removes its leg, it pulls it up past the newly attached strand. Droplets of glue slide down the setae to the tips where, because the tips are so narrow and sharply pointed, they easily disengage.\n\nMany small adhesive forces combined create a strong adhesive force. Because the spiders’ leg hairs are randomly distributed, the sticky droplets slide off the ends one at a time, which prevents the forces combining to become too strong. In this way, the spider can manipulate sticky silk strands and position them while building its web, and then safely and easily pull its leg away afterwards.\n\n"}, {"Source": "oriental hornet's cuticle", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "harvest solar energy", "Function2": "absorb sunlight", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pigments-absorb-solar-energy/", "Strategy": "Pigments Absorb Solar Energy\n\nPigments in the oriental hornet’s cuticle absorb solar energy that is turned into electrical energy.\n\nTypically, wasps and hornets are more active during the early morning as they begin their daily activities.

Nest construction behaviour of túngara frogs, Engystomops pustulosus [formerly Physalaemus pustulosus], has features that may circumvent these problems. Pairs build nests in periodic bursts of foam production and egg deposition, three discrete phases being discernible. The first is characterized by a bubble raft without egg deposition and an approximately linear increase in duration of mixing events with time. This phase may reduce initial over-dispersion of foam precursor materials until a critical concentration is achieved. The main building phase is marked by mixing events and start-to-start intervals being nearly constant in duration. During the final phase, mixing events do not change in duration but intervals between them increase in an exponential-like fashion. Pairs joining a colonial nesting abbreviate their initial phase, presumably by exploiting a pioneer pair’s bubble raft, thereby reducing energy and material expenditure, and time exposed to predators. Finally, eggs are deposited only in the centre of nests with a continuously produced, approximately 1 cm deep egg-free cortex that protectively encloses hatched larvae in stranded nests.” \n\n“Several tropical frogs, known as foam-nesters, also build a nest of bubbles. The mother exudes a fluid and beats it into microscopic bubbles with her hind legs. She then lays her eggs inside, and her mate, who has clung to her back throughout, fertilizes them. As the parents leave, the outer bubbles harden to form a protective case that encloses a foamy core of several thousand eggs. This foam nursery provides shelter from predators, bacteria, and sunlight, as well as preventing dehydration. Because the foam is mostly air it supplies all the embryos’ oxygen needs until well after hatching. The nest then disintegrates, and the young emerge from the crowded apartment and, all being well, drop into the water below.”\n\n“The foam nests of the túngara frog (Engystomops pustulosus) [formerly Physalaemus pustulosus] form a biocompatible incubation medium for eggs and sperm while resisting considerable environmental and microbiological assault. We have shown that much of this behaviour can be attributed to a cocktail of six proteins, designated ranaspumins (Rsn-1 to Rsn-6), which predominate in the foam. These fall into two discernable classes based on sequence analysis and biophysical properties. Rsn-2, with an amphiphilic amino acid sequence unlike any hitherto reported, exhibits substantial detergent-like surfactant activity necessary for production of foam, yet is harmless to the membranes of eggs and spermatozoa. A further four (Rsn-3 to Rsn-6) are lectins, three of which are similar to fucolectins found in teleosts but not previously identified in a land vertebrate, though with a carbohydrate binding specificity different from previously described fucolectins. The sixth, Rsn-1, is structurally similar to proteinase inhibitors of the cystatin class, but does not itself appear to exhibit any such activity. The nest foam itself, however, does exhibit potent cystatin activity. Rsn-encoding genes are transcribed in many tissues of the adult frogs, but the full cocktail is present only in oviduct glands. Combinations of lectins and cystatins have known roles in plants and animals for defence against microbial colonization and insect attack. Túngara nest foam displays a novel synergy of selected elements of innate defence plus a specialized surfactant protein, comprising a previously unreported strategy for protection of unattended reproductive stages of animals.” "}, {"Source": "pearl oyster's protein", "Application": "hard materials", "Function1": "guide mineral crystal growth", "Function2": "contribute to strength and shape", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/protein-complex-guides-nacre-formation/", "Strategy": "Protein Complex Guides Nacre Formation\n\nThe protein, Pif, secreted by pearl oysters contributes to the strength and shape of the shell due to key amino acids that guide mineral crystal growth.\nBehind every hard, mineral crystalline material in nature, there’s a bevy of soft proteins guiding its formation and contributing to its strength and resilience.

Actin polymer filaments, the basis of cellular skeletons (cytoskeleton), cross-link to each other in different ways to form a variety of network archictectures.

The amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, uses actin filament and ABPs to form structural materials with different shapes and properties for diverse functions such as locomotion, internal transport of nutrients, and reproduction. To play these various functional roles, actin fiber networks need to be quickly and repeatedly broken down and reformed. One way to control these changes is by varying pH levels. D. discoideum‘s ABPs contain a high content of the amino acid, histidine, which makes the actin fiber networks susceptible to structural regulation by pH adjustment. The adjustment conditions that effect ABP positioning and concentration allow for the cell to change its cytoskeletal shape and properties in relatively short order.\n\n"}, {"Source": "larval jewel beetle's mandible", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "strong beak", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/metal-free-beaks-are-strong/", "Strategy": "Metal‑free Beaks Are Strong\n\nThe mandibles of the larval jewel beetle are as hard as some stainless steels by sheathing chitin fibers in protein and cross-linking.\nLarval jewel beetles spend up to five years boring through hardwood before metamorphosizing into adult beetles and emerging.

It’s hard to imagine that such a standout hue could be due not to the normal absorption of light that produces color, but to the shape of ultra-tiny, disordered structures within the barbs of the bird’s feathers. These nanoscale formations bend and bounce different wavelengths of light in different ways.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nBarbs are the individual comblike fronds that extend out from the stiff center of a feather and then stick together to form the vane. Looking extremely closely at the blue parts of bluebird feathers, scientists have discovered that the barbs are made of long strands of a protein called β-keratin tangled together, with air in between. The tangles scatter different wavelengths of incoming light evenly, creating a single color that looks the same from whichever angle it’s being viewed. This is different from iridescent light, which is produced when light is reflected unevenly in different directions. Iridescence causes the color to change depending on what direction an observer is looking at it from (think of feathers on a peacock or grackle).\n\nThe nanostructures that help create the blue for bluebird feathers are very similar to the shape that large molecules take when they are separating out of a solvent—a process not unlike how oil forms spheres when mixed with water and is then allowed to settle out. In fact, scientists think that the configuration arises during the feather’s development in exactly this way.\n\nFirst the cells produce β-keratin. Next, the β-keratin forms a long chain, which causes it to begin to separate in a way that mirrors the way molecules separate out of a solvent. Then, at a certain genetically determined point, the molecules start linking to each other in a way that causes the separation to stop. Exactly when the process stops determines the color produced.\n\nThe configuration that the molecules end up adopting is easy to achieve because it’s the shape that chemistry and physics dictate for the situation. In the case of the eastern bluebird, it also causes light waves to bend and scatter in a way that causes the amazing “bluebird blue” to be reflected back to an observer’s eyes. If the observer is a bluebird of the opposite sex and the configuration is just right to that bird’s eye, the two may mate and pass on the genes that regulate this process, ensuring it endures for another generation.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThis so-called “structural” approach to creating color through the configuration of molecules rather than through the use of pigments provides inspiration for the development of vivid, and more sustainable, fade-resistant paints. Lessons learned about how to direct the flow of light waves might also be used to improve solar photovoltaic cells and light technologies such as laser.\n\nBeyond that, a broader lesson comes in the form of how to think about solving problems. It just might be worth pondering broad chemical and physical principles—gravity, entropy, magnetic attraction, etc.—and consider how they   might be helpful in achieving an end. Designs based on, and taking advantage of, universal laws can be far more efficient and compatible with living things than those that ignore the basic laws of nature.\n\n"}, {"Source": "micromonospora echinospora bacteria's glycosyltransferase", "Application": "sugar cation", "Function1": "perform reversible reaction", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/enzymes-catalyze-reversible-reactions/", "Strategy": "Enzymes Catalyze Reversible Reactions\n\nGlycosyltransferase enzymes produced by Micromonospora echinospora bacteria reversibly catalyze complex organic reactions between sugars and other molecules.\nConventional industrial techniques for glycosylating organic compounds rely upon multi-step organic synthesis reactions; these reactions usually require toxic reagents and solvents and are not readily reversible. \n\nGlycosyltransferase enzymes represent a superior way to perform the same task.

In this study, using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, as a model insect species, we show that an entirely different and unexpected mechanism accounts for the selective action of chitinases and possibly other molting enzymes. The molting fluid enzyme chitinase, which degrades the matrix polysaccharide chitin, is not excluded from the newly synthesized cuticle as previously assumed. Instead, the new cuticle is protected from chitinase action by the T. castaneum Knickkopf (TcKnk) protein. TcKnk colocalizes with chitin in the new cuticle and organizes it into laminae. Down-regulation of TcKnk results in chitinase-dependent loss of chitin, severe molting defects, and lethality at all developmental stages.

To a mathematician it may be an object of intrigue or inspiration. But to the creature that made it, a shell is predominantly a protection. It protects the organism from harm in the form of predators, rocks, and other inanimate objects in its environment. But it poses a bit of a problem, too: How does an animal grow when it’s encased in a container that can’t grow with it?\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe solution for the chambered nautilus (Nautilus pompilius) is simple and elegant. When it gets too large for its existing space, the (ultimately) volleyball-size nautilus adds on to the open end of its shell, expanding the diameter in a spiral configuration. And, in a remarkable and timely example of repurposing, it does not abandon its old space. Rather, it closes it off with a wall, creating a chamber that it uses to help stay buoyant as its body gets heavier.\n\nNautiluses live in the South Pacific, hundreds of meters beneath the surface of the ocean. They make their shell by mixing sugars, proteins, calcium, and other minerals, then adding the resulting crystallized material to the lip of the existing shell. But that’s not all. Every 150 days or so, a nautilus forms a membrane at its tail end that separates almost all of its body from the older portion of the shell. The one exception is a tube-shaped appendage called a siphuncle that extends back through the previously constructed chambers.\n\nWhen first formed, a chamber is filled with fluid. But over time, as the growing nautilus adds bulk, the siphuncle sucks the fluid from the chamber. As a result, the shell becomes more buoyant, counterbalancing the added weight of the living animals to maintain neutral buoyancy (a condition of neither sinking nor rising).\n\nOver the course of its life, a nautilus might add up to 30 chambers. In addition to gradually adjusting for its own increasing weight, it also can add or remove fluid from the old chambers more quickly to compensate for sudden changes such as a hefty meal or a sudden loss of part of its shell.\n\nThe Potential \n\nWhat lessons might we learn from the nautilus? The strategy of making and using closed chambers to take on and jettison a liquid already is used, and might be further applied, to regulate the position of submarines, drilling rigs, electricity-generating turbines and other manmade objects underwater.\n\nPerhaps more universally applicable and generally beneficial, however, is this takeaway: It’s not always necessary (or even beneficial) to throw something away when it is no longer suitable for its original purpose. Rather, we might do well to consider whether an existing structure might be retained, added to, and ultimately repurposed to provide a new and valuable benefit."}, {"Source": "desmid green algae's vacuole", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "sequester strontium", "Function2": "preferential precipitation", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/vacuoles-sequester-strontium/", "Strategy": "Vacuoles Sequester Strontium\n\nVacuoles in desmid green algae sequester Sr in the presence of excess calcium through a sulfate trap where the presence of dissolved barium leads to preferential precipitation of (Ba,Sr)SO4.\nMany cyanobacteria are known for their ability to sequester carbon dioxide through the precipitation of calcium carbonate but not many have been known to precipitate biominerals containing barium or strontium. What sets desmid green algae apart is its ability to sequester strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba).

It is, however, a lot more complicated than how it appears at first glance. The knifefish must heavily rely on its long stomach fin to keep it both moving and afloat, as its undersized side fins don’t provide the lift needed in the water. Fortunately, this fin is a marvel in the animal world when it comes to movement, allowing the fish to quickly move in all directions–including backward.\n\nThese movements are all achieved with different types of undulations (wave-like movements) that the fin is able to undergo, as in this video. Similar to a human arm or leg, the fins of a fish are controlled by muscles, and it is thanks to these muscles that the stomach fin of the knifefish is able to move in such a way. By sending undulations (picture sports fans doing the wave during a sports game) along the fin from the front to the back of the fish, the water is churned up, creating a backward directed jet that pushes the fish forward. In reverse, undulating the fin from the back to the front churns up the water toward the front of the fish, creating a forward-directed jet, which pushes the fish backward.\n\nStaying in place, however, is a bit more complicated, as two equal waveforms must be initiated. These two waves must be created along the fin, starting from the opposite sides of the fish, and meeting in the middle. Once the two waves meet, both the forward and backward jets cancel out, and water is pushed downward, creating a new downward jet that keeps the fish from sinking by pushing it upward. Using these different undulation patterns in combination, the knifefish is able to move quickly and smoothly forward or backward.\n\nThis summary was contributed by Thomas McAuley-Biasi.\n\n"}, {"Source": "purple sea urchin teeth", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "co-orient crystal axis", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/crystals-co-orient/", "Strategy": "Crystals Co‑orient\n\nThe calcite crystals in purple sea urchin teeth are co-oriented thanks to propagation of existing crystallinity through an amorphous precursor.\n“Sea urchin teeth are remarkable and complex calcite structures,\ncontinuously growing at the forming end and self-sharpening at the\nmature grinding tip.

The squirrel then glides to a tree 100 feet (30 meters) away where it hopes to find fungi to eat.\n\nThe ability to glide has evolved at least six separate times in mammals, suggesting it gives certain species advantages that may include saving the energy from walking and climbing, expanding their foraging range, or avoiding exposure to predators.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nA flying squirrel’s ability to glide comes from two anatomical features—membranes and cartilage. It has two sets of membranes that are composed of skin and muscle. One membrane stretches between each wrist and ankle, forming wing-like flaps. Behind the wrist are pieces of cartilage that bend upward like the tips of airplane wings to improve stability and minimize drag. Another membrane stretches from each ankle to the tail.\n\nChanges in body position allow the squirrel to alter aerodynamic forces such as lift and drag. When researchers studied the aerodynamics of flying squirrels by filming and analyzing their glides in nature, they found the squirrels did not glide under equilibrium, but instead continuously changed their velocities and forces throughout three phases of “flight.” During those phases, the squirrel’s body tilts up, and the net aerodynamic forces rotate from pointing forward to upward, and then towards the back. This corresponds to its acceleration increasing, reaching its peak, and decreasing.\n\nThe Potential \n\nUnderstanding how mammals like the northern flying squirrel glide could improve parachute and skydiving suit designs as well as improve airplane aeronautics.

The wax is made up of long chains of carbon atoms attached to each other by single chemical bonds.

Furthermore, a female tammar wallaby can carry the heavy load of the infant “joey” in her pouch without increasing her cost of locomotion. These remarkable feats are likely due to the storage and recovery of elastic energy by the large springy tendons in the wallaby’s hind legs. During the leaping, aerial phase of the hop cycle, the wallaby’s forward movement represents kinetic energy and the gravitational pull back to the ground is a form of potential energy. These energies transform into elastic strain energy of stretching tendons when the foot hits the ground. That energy can then be recovered in the elastic recoil of those tendons that helps propel the wallaby back off the ground. As much as 90% of the energy stored in the tendon can be recovered for such reuse. The key to this energy recovery is that muscles attached to the tendons are stiff enough so that their length changes little as they generate force. If the muscles changed in length a lot, they might absorb and dissipate the tendon’s elastic energy, making it unavailable to power the next hop.\n\nThe faster the wallaby goes and the heavier the load, the more elastic energy gets stored and recovered, hence the cost of locomotion can be unchanged with speed or load over a normal range of speeds. The use of tendons and elastic energy is also found in many other large animals that run (such as horses and turkeys), but to a much less dramatic extent in terms of energy savings as those observed in kangaroos and wallabies. It is as yet unclear exactly why these macropods experience such high savings in energy compared with other animals. The general strategy of elastic energy storage as a means of increasing locomotor efficiency is also observed in a variety of swimming animals, from squid to dolphins.\n\nThe use of elastic energy storage could be considered in the human design of all sorts of moving structures to increase energy efficiency. “Spring loaded locomotion” has been used in the design of the pogo stick and some prosthetic legs."}, {"Source": "gliding bird's wing", "Application": "aircraft", "Function1": "continuously change shape and size", "Function2": "adjust wing sweep", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/change-increases-aerodynamic-performance/", "Strategy": "Change Increases Aerodynamic Performance\n\nWings of gliding birds increase aerodynamic performance by continuously changing shape and size.\n\n“Gliding birds continually change the shape and size of their wings, presumably to exploit the profound effect of wing morphology on aerodynamic performance.

The bird finds this so irritating that it tries to wipe the berry off by scraping it on to another branch and in doing so, rams it into a crevice. The seed then puts out a root which worms its way into the tree and eventually connects with the vessels within the branch that carry the tree’s sap. And with that as food, it flourishes.” (Attenborough 1995:229-230)\n“The results presented in this study illustrate the remarkable characteristics of the cellulose located in the thick cell walls of the viscin tissue from V. album. Initially, the microfibrils of this cellulose are indeed tightly coiled perpendicularly to the viscin cell axes. Due to the hemicelluloses that are also present and when the hydration is sufficient, these cellulose microfibrils are free to move past each other in such a way that the wall of the viscin tissue is able to get deformed upon the slightest stretching action. This deformation can reach extraordinary values of several hundred folds without breakage, each viscin cell giving one tiny cellulose filament having no more than a few microns in width, as opposed to the initial viscin cells that had diameters of several tens of micron. As deduced from diffraction experiments (Figure 9(a)), the orientation of the cellulose in these stretched filaments is unusually high. The combination of this high orientation with the fairly large molecular weight of the corresponding cellulose indicates that these filaments should have high mechanical properties. Their strength must in fact be correlated to the biological function of the viscin tissue, which is to hold firmly the mistletoe seed through the bird guts. When expelled from the bird and dropped on the branch of a tree, the seeds will normally stick to the branch thanks to their hemicellulosic glue. Some of the seeds will even dangle down from the branch, held by the viscin cellulosic filaments. Under the action of the wind, these seeds will be brought back in contact with the branch to which they will adhere for further germination. This phenomenon explains why mistletoe sometimes germinates even at the underlying part of branches.” \n \n“As a group, the Australian mistletoes have developed a rather more specialised system of transport than that employed by their European relative. One particular bird, the mistletoe bird, eats little other than mistletoe berries. There are so many species, each with its own fruiting season, that the bird is able to find berries throughout the year and it flies along regular migration routes in order to do so. Its digestive system is specially modified to cope with this diet. For some reason, it processes the berries with remarkable speed so that one will take less than half an hour to travel from entry to exit. When it emerges the seed still has considerable residual stickiness and so remains fastened to the bird’s rear. The defecating bird does not, however, sit transversely across a twig waiting for the mistletoe seed to drop off. Instead, it turns so that its body is aligned along the twig and carefully wipes its bottom on the bark beneath. This fixes the seed to the tree but threads of the seed’s glue still remain attached to the bird’s rear and it has to make three separate sideways jumps along the twig before the connection is finally broken.” "}, {"Source": "oyster reef", "Application": "sustainable concrete", "Function1": "form extensive reefs", "Function2": "maintain habitat", "Function3": "filter water and improve its quality", "Function4": "protect coastlines from erosion", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/adhesive-is-both-strong-and-flexible/", "Strategy": "Adhesive Is Both Strong and Flexible\n\nOysters build strong but flexible reefs using minerals in a sticky protein web.\n\nIntroduction \n\nOysters are a delicacy to some and a staple food to others, but they are also vital to coastal ecosystems.

Geckos appear to keep their sticky feet clean and functional through dynamic self-cleaning.\n\nFor the tokay gecko (Gekko gecko), when its foot detaches from a surface the animal is walking on, its toes have the ability to hyperextend: the toes peel off the surface starting at the tip, and curl up away from the surface (human fingers, for comparison, cannot voluntarily hyperextend, and are much more functional in flexion). When the setae at the tip of the toe are first pulled, they stretch a little and store elastic energy as the spatulae are still attached to the surface. As the toe continues to curl up, the setae suddenly detach from the substrate. Their stretchy nature and ability to spread out as the toe curls up and back results in a flinging motion that can dislodge particles caught on and between the spatulae. This action proceeds sequentially from the tip to the base of the toe, until the entire foot is free. When gecko toes hyperextend and produce this flinging motion (what researchers call “setal jump-off”), they shed contaminating particles twice as fast as they would if the toes didn’t hyperextend. After four steps, the feet can regain almost 80% of their adhesive force.\n\nThis dynamic mechanism appears to work in concert with other passive mechanisms for self-cleaning, like particle removal that results when contaminants are more attracted to the substrate than the gecko foot. As a result, contaminating particles are both flung off the setae and deposited on the substrate during walking."}, {"Source": "sponge's barbed filaments", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "anchor sponge", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/barbed-filaments-anchor/", "Strategy": "Barbed Filaments Anchor\n\nFilaments anchor sponges in soft sediments using barbed tips\n\nSponges are some of the most simple of animals.

All sponges have skeletons and in some, the appropriately named “glass sponges”, the skeleton is made up of needle-like shards of glass.\n\nGlass sponges live in very deep water where they must be capable of remaining anchored to the soft sediment of the deep ocean floor. Euplectella aspergillum, Venus’s flower basket, anchors itself with numerous hair-like glass skeletal elements called spicules, each up to 10 cm long. The spicules are bundled together where they attach to the sponge’s body, forming a thick cable, but they spread out singly into multiple tiny threads that run through the sediment. Each spicule has a series of barbs along its length and at the terminal end is a crown of barbs that works much like a sea anchor, holding the sponge steady in the soft shifting sand and silt.\n\nLike many interactions in nature, Venus’s flower basket makes use of very large numbers of relatively weak attachments that when combined form a strong bond.

But it turns out that’s not the only benefit of these shingle-like structures. The configuration of the scales also contributes to flying efficiency as the butterfly dances and dips its way through the air.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nIn animals and inanimate objects alike, four forces make flight possible: lift, weight, thrust, and drag. When all balance out, the object stays in one position in the air, like a hummingbird or a helicopter. If one or more are stronger than the others, the object moves up, down, forward, or backward.\n\nThe surface of a butterfly’s wing is covered with hundreds of thousands of overlapping scales, arranged like shingles on a roof. The size, shape, and orientation of the scales alters the relative size of the four forces of flight by affecting how air flows over the butterfly’s wings and how vortices (air swirls) form.\n\nNatural observations and experiments have shown that with fewer scales, butterflies don’t flap their wings as fully, and they have a harder time flying upward. Though the details are not yet well defined or described, it’s clear that scales help the butterfly fly by providing lift.\n\nThe organized patterns of bumps created by fish scales are known to reduce drag essentially by combing the passing water into smooth, orderly layers. Butterfly scales may produce a similar effect. They also can alter the formation of vortices in certain parts of the wing. For instance, the bumps created by overlapping scales at the front end of the wings could slow the formation of vortices there and reduce the amount of energy going into forming the vortices. Since vortices create drag as they spin off the surface, this would decrease drag and therefore increase lift and thrust.\n\nThe Potential \n\nBy studying how various configurations of butterfly wing scales affect flight, designers can get ideas for how to improve the efficiency and versatility of the flight of conventional aircraft, parachutes, kites, drones, and other objects traveling through the air. They might also inform the design of more efficient wind turbines and reduce the materials needed for structural stability in tall buildings. The micro-geometry of wing scales can provide valuable insights for the design of innovative flying machines that incorporate flapping into their operation and of cars, trains, and other ground vehicles. They also can provide insights into improving the efficiency of cargo ships and other vehicles that travel through water or other media.\n\n"}, {"Source": "european blowfly's foot fluid", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "generate adhesion", "Function2": "generate strong attractive force", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/capillary-action-aids-adhesion/", "Strategy": "Capillary Action Aids Adhesion\n\nFluid secreted from tiny hairs on the feet of the European blowfly help it stick to surfaces via capillary action adhesion.\n\n“A study of fly footprints shows that the offending insect relies mainly on capillary forces generated by fluid secreted from its feet.

At best they can creep slowly along the bottom.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nWith that lack of motility, it’s hard to imagine how reproduction could result in anything but a large stacks of mussels that would quickly exceed their habitat’s ability to support them. But nature has found a way.\n\nMother mussels incubate their eggs until they hatch into grain-of-sand-size larvae called glochidia. Then they transfer the glochidia to nearby fish. The glochidia clamp down on the fish’s gills, where they remain for several weeks, not only sucking sustenance but also taking advantage of the free ride. Eventually the glochidia drop off and colonize a new location.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe plain pocketbook’s artful strategy for spreading its offspring around is a remarkable example of nature mimicking nature. It provides inspiration for thinking outside the box when it comes to solving problems: In this instance, adaptive pressure to be mobile in water produced not the ability to swim, but the ability to latch onto another organism better equipped to do so.\n\nThere is also in this story a model of embracing external forces to shape your own strategy. Mussels are not known to be able to see the details of nearby fish or to in any way judge the visual accuracy of their lures. Their genetic code is simply varying the adult females’ appearance, and it’s the bass’s influence that shapes the mimicry through natural selection.\n\nThis inspires consideration of what to pay attention to when designing something to meet a specific need. In this instance, evolution emulated the traits of bait to catch a predator’s eye—the horizontal stripe, the eyespot, the waving tail—but not the other characteristics of a prey fish, such as scales and pectoral fins, that aren’t required to signal, “this looks like food.” For any level of mimicry that humans undertake, a good first step is to identify which traits matter most, and a good way to find them is to create many variations and see which get the response we’re looking for.\n\n"}, {"Source": "red mangrove's buttresses", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "increase stability", "Function2": "increase footprint", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/buttresses-of-red-mangrove-improve-stability/", "Strategy": "Buttresses of Red Mangrove Improve Stability\n\nButtresses of the red mangrove enable growth in thin soils by efficiently increasing footprint\n\nThe red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) is a coastal tree that grows in shallow estuaries throughout tropical regions.

Our bodies are more than half water, and other organisms depend on it as well for everything from photosynthesis to maintaining their shape to eliminating waste.\n\nWhere water is in a living thing, is as important as whether water is available. Too much water inside a cell, and it will burst like a balloon. Too little, and it will dry out and die.\n\nHow does a cell keep the amount of water just right? The answer lies in hourglass-shaped molecules with a tunnel down the middle that are very, very picky about what they let through.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nAll living things are made up of cells. All cells have membranes that separate them from the rest of the world. And all membranes have channels that let molecules in and out. One type of channel, called aquaporins, selectively let water molecules move across the cell membrane. These channels are so important that they are found in organisms belonging to all kingdoms of life.\n\nHow do aquaporins separate water from other molecules? The answer lies in their shape and the way electrical charge is distributed across the proteins they’re made of.\n\nAquaporins are proteins, which are made up of long chains of smaller molecules called amino acids. Different kinds of amino acids attract or repel each other, creating stretches of shapes such as sheets and helices within the molecule.\nAn aquaporin molecule contains six long stretches of helices that stick through a cell membrane like a peephole through a door. Together, they form a tiny tunnel about the size of a water molecule. The center of the aquaporin channel carries a positive charge, which repels other positively charged molecules and prevents them from passing through. Thus, only small, uncharged molecules such as water are able to pass through the channel. Increasing efficiency, aquaporin molecules tend to appear in groups of four arranged together, creating a fifth pore in the middle that also moves water across the membrane.\n\nSome aquaporins also have an additional filter embedded in their structure that is made up of specific amino acids that can filter out or let in  a selection of other molecules, such as glycerol, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.. But many aquaporins are exclusive to water, creating an amazing mechanism for separating the “molecule of life” from everything else. Because water inherently travels from areas of high concentration to low concentration,  the channels do not need to use energy to pump the water molecules across the membrane. Instead, passive transport allows the water molecules to flow in or out of the cell, energy-free.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe ability of aquaporins to separate water from other molecules without requiring an active pump opens the door to an energy-efficient way to remove contaminants from wastewater or purify drinking water. The concept might also be applied to creating customized channels that selectively filter other types of small molecules. This would make it possible to increase the concentration of a desired substance or remove undesired contaminants from a product.\n\n"}, {"Source": "fish scale", "Application": "scaled coatings in pipes", "Function1": "decrease drag", "Function2": "minimize turbulence", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/why-fish-scales-arent-such-a-drag/", "Strategy": "Why Fish Scales Aren’t Such a Drag\n\nThe shape of scales causes water flow to streak across fish skin, reducing turbulence and minimizing drag.\nIntroduction \n\nAirplanes, submarines, and cars are designed with smooth materials because they have less drag than rough ones.

The surface of the rounded rim (called the peristome) is especially slippery, causing insects to fall right into the fatal pitcher. What makes the pitcher rim such a precarious place?\n\nScientists have identified two different, interacting factors that make the rim a low-friction surface: first, it is patterned with a series of micron-sized ridges that run into the pitcher. The ridges are made of overlapping epidermal cells, like roof tiles, that give the surface texture directionality—it’s easier to slide toward the inside of the pitcher than it is to slide the opposite way and escape.

They are stiff in the direction under which they are loaded during flight, but very flexible in the other direction. This works because the hook and groove mesh holds them in place and counteracts their side-to-side flexibility. At the same time, if forces do become too large and the barbs are at risk of permanent damage, they are still able to twist, presenting their flat flexible side to the force, bending and spilling the load. In this way, they flex out of the way when necessary, reassuming their prior position later and zippering back up again, as good as new.\n\n"}, {"Source": "rotator cuff", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "manage force", "Function2": "manage weight", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/shoulder-joint-manages-stress/", "Strategy": "Shoulder Joint Manages Stress\n\nRotator cuff in humans manages force via an extra pliable region\n\nJoining together materials with very different properties is challenging in nature as well as in manufacturing. When different materials are joined, forces can build up at the interface that cause failure. This type of failure is called “fatigue” and it can occur at lower levels of stress than each material could withstand on its own. In engineering, as in nature, failure almost always occurs at points of fatigue, and not in the bulk material.\n\nOne of the largest materials discrepancies in nature is the joining of muscle to bone via tendon. This is particularly important at the shoulder, where not only must the joint manage the weight of the limb itself, but also anything else we might carry. In 2019, the weightlifting world record was set by Lasha Talakhadze of Georgia, who successfully lifted 264 kg (582 lb), the equivalent of about 4 people. That’s a lot of weight, all going through his shoulders!\n\nOne way of reducing the risk of fatigue is to join different materials with a transition zone that has a gradient of properties from one to the other. In the rotator cuff (the tendon array that attaches the muscles of the shoulder to the upper end of the arm) there is a gradient, but it is more complex than a simple transition. Starting at the collarbone and moving towards the tendon, the tissue is softer and more flexible the further away it is from the bone. The softening follows a sigmoidal pattern, which means the change in flexibility with distance from the bone is slow near the bone, and becomes more dramatic further away. A similar transition occurs at the tendon end of the join. However, instead of becoming more rigid like bone, as we might expect for a smooth transition from tendon to bone, this tissue also transitions into a region that is more pliable. This means that the gradient starts with bone, becomes more flexible than either bone or tendon in the middle, and then firms up slightly to match the properties of tendon. This extra pliable region seems to manage the stresses as they arise, preventing their build up elsewhere in the joint and reducing injury due to fatigue.\n\nThe shoulder joint requires some of the strongest muscles in the body to attach to the bone of the arm via very small attachment sites."}, {"Source": "snake's concertina movement", "Application": "search-and-rescue missions", "Function1": "maneuver through tight spaces", "Function2": "move through narrow channels", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/accordion-movement-propels-snakes-through-narrow-channels/", "Strategy": "Accordion Technique Allows Controlled\nMovement Through Narrow Channels\n\nSnakes use zig-zag anchor points and friction to maneuver through tight spaces.\n\nIntroduction \n\nNavigating swiftly through all sorts of difficult terrain, from scorching sand to rocky crevices, snakes have evolved extraordinarily specialized methods of locomotion—all, obviously, without the aid of any appendages whatsoever. Scientists are particularly interested in the technique snakes use to move through narrow channels, called “concertina” movement, as it could have life-saving applications in the field of robotics.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe word “concertina” refers to a small musical instrument akin to an accordion. It is an apt name for the motion described. In order to pass through a narrow canal, a snake will condense and extend itself continuously, like the movement of the bellows as a concertina player plays. First, the snake will extend its head along the canal, then bring a point on one side of its body, just behind its head, to one the wall; it then folds its body up so that another point on its other side slightly further back can press against the opposite wall, and another, and another. When the snake has three to five such anchor points, it moves its head forward again. The front points come off the wall, but the points further back hold the snake in place until a new hold can be created farther ahead.\n\nResearch has shown that friction is crucial to the functionality of this movement. If you were to run your finger down a snake from head to tail, it would feel quite smooth. The lack of friction in this direction allows for swift forward movement. The overlapping scales, however, create a jagged surface in the other direction. During the concertina movement, snakes actually dig their scales into the walls around them a bit, creating high resistance to backward movement, and allowing snakes to push themselves forward.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThis simple combination of texture and movement has great potential for the field of exploratory robots. One possible context is in search-and-rescue missions where the passages through rubble created by a collapsed building are narrow, irregular, and unpredictable.\n\nMore applications are found in the field of bioengineering and medicine. One day we may very well go to the doctor for colonoscopy procedures, and have tiny snake-like robots get where they need to go while minimizing pain and damage to surrounding tissues.\n\nOn first thought, it might seem strange to associate snakes with medicine and healing, but think again. The ancient Greek “rod of Asclepius,” showing a snake wound around a staff was such a sign, and it mirrors a staff made by Moses to heal the Israelites in the book of Numbers. It continues to appear in the logo of the World Health Organization and many other medical groups around the world.

Charles Darwin first mused on this mystery in the early 1800s, but only recently have scientists found a solid explanation. It turns out that an itsy bitsy spider can go up something much more exciting than a water spout.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nTo begin its journey, a spider crawls to an exposed point, raises its abdomen, shoots out a couple strands of silk, and then jets away. For a long time it was thought the spider was simply carried off on wind currents. However, the physics just didn’t make sense: spiders “balloon” like this when the wind is low, and light air currents couldn’t explain the impressive velocity with which they take flight. Furthermore, spiders can’t shoot out much silk on their own; some external force had to be pulling it from their spinnerets. Now we know: spiders can sense and surf on electric charges in the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFor most current human flight applications, electric repulsion and attraction aren’t strong enough to overcome the force of the Earth’s gravity. However, nanotechnology, 3D printing, and other advances are producing sophisticated machinery of remarkably small sizes and light weights. On these scales, “flying spider” technology could create exciting opportunities for development.\n\nIf we think of all the human-designed products that utilize wind, how many could be shrunken and engineered to use electrical currents in the atmosphere?"}, {"Source": "skeletal muscle", "Application": "synthetic muscles for prosthetic limbs", "Function1": "generate force", "Function2": "enable movement", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/skeletal-muscles-generate-force/", "Strategy": "Skeletal Muscles Generate Force\n\nSkeletal muscles contract and relax, generating force and enabling movement.\nIntroduction \n\nHumans have over 650 skeletal muscles that make up about 40% of our body weight. Skeletal muscles generate the force that all vertebrates need to move. In fact, every action we take requires them to either contract or relax. But how exactly do they do it?\n\nThe first clues came in 1682 when Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, the Dutch “father of microbiology” looked at muscles through his self-made magnifying lenses: “I gave my mind to this subject and now say that, since we see that a large muscle in its turn consists of many thousands of [flesh-fibres], and that each flesh-fibre again consists internally of filaments . . . that each filament is in its turn a muscle of flesh.”\n\nThe Strategy \n\nWe now know these filaments as myofibrils. Thousands of myofibrils make up a single muscle fiber like tiny straws stacked inside a much larger one. Each myofibril is divided into cylindrical sections stacked on top of one another and linked together.\n\nThese structures are called sarcomeres, and they’re the smallest contracting elements of a muscle. When you decide to flex your biceps, nerves release chemicals which trigger the sarcomeres to squish themselves inward like flattened soda cans, which shortens the myofibrils. This pulls and contracts the muscle fibers, which flexes the entire muscle. In essence, a muscle contraction is the sum of its sarcomere contractions.\n\nA single sarcomere shortens itself through a process called “the sliding filament theory.” Sarcomeres are made primarily of two proteins: actin and myosin. Actin proteins form thin filaments that extend from both flat ends of the cylindrical sarcomere towards the center without connecting, like opposite walls with shelves that don’t touch. In between each actin filament, thick myosin filaments stretch across most of the sarcomere. Chemical changes cause myosin to bind with actin and pull the “shelves” inward, shrinking the sarcomere from both sides.\n\nThe Potential \n\nScientists and engineers are developing artificial muscles that simulate contraction and relaxation. These designs could enhance how robots move, improve pump designs, and lead to better automatic valves, switches, and sensors. One day we may even develop synthetic muscles for prosthetic limbs to assist people with mobility challenges."}, {"Source": "perching bird's feet", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "perch on weak surface", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/feet-stay-put/", "Strategy": "Feet Stay Put\n\nThe feet of perching birds can perch even on weak, slippery surfaces due to the rough bumpy skin on their soles.\n“The Passeriformes or ‘perching birds’ have the typical bird foot: three toes forward and one behind, with which a bird can perch crosswise on a branch.

In order to be considered lightweight, bird bones must be light relative to something else. Looking at their thin and delicate appearance, it might be logical to assume that bird bones are light relative to non-flying animals of a similar size, however, this is not the case. Weight for weight, bird skeletons take up the same body mass percentage as the skeletons of equivalently sized mammals.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nSome birds have pneumatized (air-filled) spaces within their largest bones, which can reduce skeletal mass by between 8 and 13 %. This aids with flying, however it is restricted to only some bird species and so it cannot be critical for flight.\n\nThe bones of flying birds are thinner than those of other animals. In order to be both thin and maintain the strength required to cope with the huge physical loads that are applied to them in flight, bird bones are denser than those of equivalently sized flightless animals. Bird bones are thin, but they are far from as delicate as they appear.\n\nBirds tend to be small animals, which does aid with flying, and they stand out from flightless animals of a similar size in that they have a relatively large surface area to volume ratio. Even when standing with wings folded, birds have a much larger surface area for their mass than other animals. With wings extended, this increases dramatically, creating lift and enabling control.\n\nLarge bones require large support structures, that is, musculature to move them and blood vessels to supply them with nutrients. Although bird bones themselves are denser and, proportionally, take up a normal percentage of body weight, their small relative volume means they require less in the way of support. In this way, the skeletons of birds enable them to have a smaller total body mass relative to their surface area. Bird skeletons are not lightweight, but because of their unique structure, bird bodies can be.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFlight is a delicate balance between the lift and the energy required to generate lift. Birds must consume enough calories to sustain flight for migration, to forage for food, and to build nests. Nature found an equilibrium in birds by designing dense bones that efficiently support smaller bodies. Flight for humans (indeed all modes of our transportation) also must consider efficiency. In other words, how far we can go on the available fuel? With more efficiently designed structures  (bones) of cars, airplanes, and cargo ships, we consume less fuel and emit less pollution."}, {"Source": "earthworm's flexible body", "Application": "burrowing robot", "Function1": "burrow through soil", "Function2": "move through soil", "Function3": "crawl through tight spaces", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/a-flexible-body-allows-the-earthworm-to-burrow-through-soil/", "Strategy": "A Flexible Body Allows the\nEarthworm to Burrow Through Soil\n\nThe soft, fluid-filled flexible body of the earthworm enables it to burrow through soil using its unique set of muscles and internal fluid to maintain shape.\n\nIntroduction \n\nEarthworms are commonly found in healthy soils, whether it’s your backyard or a grassland. They are soft, slimy tube-shaped organisms without a skeleton or limbs. Earthworms are decomposers that add air and disperse nutrients in the soil as they burrow. As decomposers, they consume dead organic material such as leaves and roots. After consuming the material, they break it down and excrete it as nutrients. The spreading of nutrients enhances the health of the soil, benefitting the earthworm’s community of living organisms.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe soft, flexible body of the earthworm is divided into segments, which allows it to easily move through the soil to find food. The earthworm’s body is also known as a hydrostatic skeleton, which is a flexible skeleton filled with fluid. A common earthworm (L. terrestris ) can range from 110-200 mm in length with anywhere from 135-150 segments in its body.  Each segment of the worm’s body contains muscles that work independently of every other segment.  The internal walls separate the segments and are lined with circular and longitudinal muscles. Circular muscles are wrapped around the circumference of each segment Longitudinal muscles extend down the length of each segment. The muscles create a soft barrier between segments, allowing the segments to be controlled independently. Inside each segment, there is fluid that holds the segment’s shape. As the earthworm burrows, it squeezes into tightly packed soil. This creates a high-pressure environment that could damage the worm. However, the fluid inside the segments helps prevent damage to the earthworm. Fluid cannot change volume because the molecules in the fluid are very close together. The high-pressure environment cannot press the molecules even closer, thus maintaining the earthworm’s shape.\n\nThe Potential \n\nAn earthworm has a special ability to crawl through tight spaces. Humans have designed robots to mimic this crawling motion. These robots could be made to burrow deep underground and distribute materials or test underground conditions quickly without the need to dig large holes.\n\nThis strategy was contributed by Sue White and edited by Natalie Chen."}, {"Source": "maple seed", "Application": "monocopter", "Function1": "provide lift force", "Function2": "prolong flight time", "Function3": "increase seed dispersion", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/tornado-like-spinning-increases-seed-dispersion/", "Strategy": "Tornado‑like Spinning\nIncreases Seed Dispersion\n\nThe leading edge of the tornado-like spinning maple seed provides a constant lift force, allowing seeds to disperse over a greater area.\n\nIntroduction \n\nScattering seeds is a prominent mechanism in all plants, often assisted by birds and gusts of wind.  When birds eat the seeds of trees, they transport and defecate them, creating a randomized scatter where new trees will grow.  When caught in a gust of wind, seeds fall and end up growing in close vicinity to one another. To increase the reach of where their seeds are planted, maple tree seeds twirl in a tornado-like vortex, creating more lift than their non-twirling counterparts.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe leading edge of the seed lowers the air pressure over the top of the seed, sucking the wind of the seed upwards, giving it extra lift, or extra travel time. This leads to a prolonged arrival at the ground, and more efficient dispersal.\n\nThe lift mechanism is similar to those of insects and hovering hummingbirds who use their wings to develop a continuous air vortex, sustaining their flight. The spinning motion created by the maple seed structure sustains a lift vortex which prolongs the flight. It’s also important to note that dead (brown-colored) seeds scatter further because they have an altered center of gravity from alive (green-colored) seeds.  This is because the center of gravity in the seed is closer to the center of lift, similar to a paper airplane that is able to fly further than its opponents.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThrough careful study of how a maple seed spirals through the air, scientists have designed the smallest known monocopter. Until the mechanics of falling seeds were better understood, monocopter flight was unstable. Investigating how maple seeds deal with turbulent air could also help develop more efficient wind turbines, increasing the amount of renewable energy that can be extracted from the breeze.\n\n"}, {"Source": "fern sperm", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "chemotaxis", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/signal-directs-sperm/", "Strategy": "Signal Directs Sperm\n\nThe sperm of ferns detect unfertilized archegonia via a malate signal.\n“In higher plants, we find positive chemotaxis in fern sperms, which respond to a malate signal from unfertilized archegonia.” "}, {"Source": "lesser burdock's seed casings", "Application": "velcro", "Function1": "disperse seed", "Function2": "attach easily to passing animal's skin, fur, or feathers", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hooked-spines-grab-onto-fibers/", "Strategy": "Hooked Spines Grab On to Fibers\n\nIncurved hooks on lesser burdock seed casings grab the hair of passing animals and disperse the seeds over a wide area.\nIntroduction \n\nIt’s happened to many of us: returning from a walk or a hike, we notice prickly seeds, or burrs, attached to our pants, our shoes, maybe even our dog’s fur. We pick them off and throw them on the ground, where they have the chance to grow into a whole new plant.\n\nThis is one way that plants can disperse their seeds over a wider area than would be possible if they simply dropped to the ground. By producing seeds that stick to passing animals, plants turn us into unwitting allies in the spread of their seeds.\n\nOne plant that utilizes this method particularly well is Arctium minus, also known as lesser burdock or common burdock, which is native to Europe but introduced across much of the world.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe fruit of lesser burdock is a round head about three-quarters of an inch (2 cm) wide, with purple petals, covered in long, flexible, spines that end in curved hooks. The spines and the petals form a globular casing around the seeds at the interior of the flower head.\n\nThe plant blooms between July and October, following the summer months of its original European habitat. As the seeds ripen, the flower dries, and the entire seed casing will separate easily from its stalk. The hooked spines attach easily to the skin, fur, or even feathers of passing animals, which then transport the seeds whither the animals wander. When eventually the animals rub the burrs off their coats, the seeds separate and disperse to the soil.\n\nBy falling along the paths of their animal hosts, the seeds are also more likely to be planted in soil that has been freshly manured, offering them higher odds of successfully germinating and growing into mature plants. Conversely, these hooks are so tenacious that birds, bats, and other small animals have found themselves caught by the hooked spines and unable to exert enough force to pull away from the plant.\n\nThe Potential \n\nLesser burdock served as the inspiration and model for the invention of Velcro, which reproduces the attachment strategy by using two strips of fabric: one which resembles the spines with curved hooks, and one which resembles animal fur with thousands of tiny loops. When the two fabrics meet, they adhere to each other in a secure but removable manner, allowing them to be reused.\n\nGeorges de Mestral, a Swiss engineer, spent eight years attempting to replicate the plant’s adhesive powers after experiencing the seeds attach to his pants and his dog on a walk through the woods in 1941. Nearly a century later, the lesser burdock’s approach to adhesive hooks has improved human endeavors as commonplace as fastening a child’s shoes and as extraordinary as bracing equipment on the International Space Station."}, {"Source": "kingfisher's beak", "Application": "designing trains", "Function1": "dive into the water without splashing", "Function2": "catch fish", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/beak-provides-streamlining/", "Strategy": "The Beak That Inspired a Bullet Train\n\nThe shape of the kingfisher beak allows it to dive into the water without splashing.\n\nIntroduction \n\nWhile beside a creek, pond, or at the ocean, you may have been fortunate to spy a kingfisher. Found the world over, kingfishers are a family of birds containing over 100 species, often visiting bodies of water, where, as their name suggests, they are masters at catching fish.\n\nThe method kingfishers use to catch fish seems simple enough. Once a kingfisher spies a fish (using special glare-reducing cells in its eyes), it leaves a perch and plunges into the water to grab it in its beak. Fish, however, have a defensive strategy that is hard to overcome. Specialized receptors along a fish’s body, known as a lateral line, sense disturbances in the flow of surrounding water. Any sudden movement of water––such as a compression wave from a diving bird––and fish are gone with a flick of the tail. If you’ve ever tried to catch a fish with your hands, you know how difficult it is to escape their detection as soon as your hand touches the water.\n\nSo how does a kingfisher, hitting the water’s surface at over thirty-six feet (eleven meters) per second, manage to grab a fish in its beak before the fish detects it and flees?\n \nThe Strategy \n\nThe secret is in the shape of the kingfisher’s beak. A long and narrow cone, the kingfisher’s beak parts and enters the water without creating a compression wave below the surface or a noisy splash above. The fine point of the conical beak presents little surface area or resistance to the water upon entry, and the evenly and gradually enlarging cross-section of the beak keeps fluid flowing smoothly around it as it penetrates further into the water column. This buys the bird crucial milliseconds to reach the fish before the fish knows to flee. The length of the beak is critical here: the longer it is, the more gradually the angle of the wedge expands. A shorter, fatter, or rounder beak would increase the wedge angle, resulting in a splash, a compression wave, and a fleeing fish.\n\nThe Potential \n\nEiji Nakatsu, chief engineer of the company operating Japan’s fastest trains, wondered if the kingfisher’s beak might serve as a model for how to redesign trains not to create such a thunderous noise when leaving tunnels and breaking through the barrier of tunnel-air and outside-air.

Herein we show that the natural quill’s geometry enables easy penetration and high tissue adhesion where the barbs specifically contribute to adhesion and unexpectedly, dramatically reduce the force required to penetrate tissue. Reduced penetration force is achieved by topography that appears to create stress concentrations along regions of the quill where the cross sectional diameter grows rapidly, facilitating cutting of the tissue. Barbs located near the first geometrical transition zone exhibit the most substantial impact on minimizing the force required for penetration. Barbs at the tip of the quill independently exhibit the greatest impact on tissue adhesion force and the cooperation between barbs in the 0–2 mm and 2–4 mm regions appears critical to enhance tissue adhesion force.

To prevent stall, a vortex (a swirl of air) moving along the bee’s wing from the abdomen delays the onset of turbulent air at higher angles of attack.\n\nAt the end of both the rearward and forward strokes, the bee’s wing rotates along its lengthwise axis to orient the leading edge into the new direction of wing travel.  This rotation resembles how a human with hands stretched out to their side, rotates their hands from palms up to palms down. This rotation at stroke reversal creates three different lift forces to enhance the overall lift: rotational, acceleration, and wake capture.  Additionally, at the rearward stroke when both wings can almost touch, a jet of air shoots out to enhance thrust and creates a low-pressure zone that jump starts lift forces during the forward stroke.\n\nDuring low-load hovering, the bee’s wing operates within a forward-to-rearward stroke range of 90 degrees at around 230 Hz.  This stroke range creates an imaginary plane called the stroke plane. To move forward and in reverse, the stroke plane is tilted forward or rearward similarly to how helicopters fly. The bee’s indirect flight muscles are tuned for this higher 230 Hz frequency, which is atypical of other insects.  To increase the bee’s speed or its ability to carry a heavy pollen load, the wings maintain a 230 Hz stroke frequency by increasing the forward-to-rearward stroke range beyond 90 degrees. At a maximum stroke, the bee can fly at 3/4 mph.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe flapping wings of bees represent a completely different approach to powered flight than human propellers, jet engines, or helicopter blades.

Like a cyclist bending low over the handlebars, this more hydrodynamic shape reduces the interaction with the water, reducing stress on the organism and preventing damage and fracture.\n\nThe Potential \n\nAs with seaweed, too much rigidity in a material may lead to fracture or failure in the face of stress.

As we grow, our jaw changes shape and size and our teeth need to be able to move to accommodate the difference. Even after we stop growing, our jaw bones are constantly being remodeled, causing subtle changes. Dental retainers take advantage of this slight flexibility applying pressure in one direction and forcing teeth to migrate slowly to a new, more preferable, position in the mouth. Other mammals, like rats, have teeth that never stop growing: their teeth must be strong and stable enough to cope with the forces generated by gnawing but flexible enough to cope with the constant movement.\n\nTeeth are held in place by tiny ligaments, called periodontal ligaments. These tiny connective tissues are made primarily from collagen. Bone and tooth cementum (the surface layer of the roots of teeth) also contain collagen, however in bone and cementum the collagen is mineralized with calcium apatite to form a hard surface.\n\nCollagen is a protein made up of multiple strands interwoven into fibers. In both bone and cementum, collagen fibers that are continuous with the mineralized tissue protrude from the hard surface. These fibers, called “Sharpey’s fibers” are the anchor points for the periodontal ligaments. Sharpey’s fibers from bone and cementum protrude into the space between the jaw bone and the tooth where the collagen bundles from each side fray and then splice with the frayed fibers from the opposite side. The fraying and splicing forms a multiply branched web of collagen instead of a bunch of cables. In this way, individual collagen fibers among the splice can be broken and reformed, allowing the slow movement of teeth without reducing the strength of attachment of the teeth in the jaw.\n\n"}, {"Source": "bee's hind legs", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "hold onto mate", "Function2": "contoured to fit female", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hind-legs-keep-bees-coupled-in-midair/", "Strategy": "Hind Legs Keep Bees Coupled in Midair\n\nBees use their hind legs to hold onto their mates, the legs often being perfectly contoured to fit onto the female. \n\nDifferences in the hind legs of bees are often a secondary sexual characteristic, affecting male bees and increasing their chances of finding a mate.\n\nThe legs are often used to hold onto the female during mating.

These passengers, called remoras, move at relative warp-speed, expending very little energy of their own as they are carried from feast to feast.\n\nRemoras feed on scraps of food shredded by their actively hunting hosts, and on harmful parasites on their hosts’ skins. That service is part of what makes the arrangement helpful to the larger animals. Catching a ride, remoras also increase their chances of reproduction, since a good host is a great place to find a mate.\n\nAll this activity requires being able to hang on tightly and efficiently, but also to detach at will for eating, mating, and other activities. So how do they do it?\n\nThe Strategy \n\nA remora’s stick-to-itiveness stems from a unique suction disc structure on the top of its flat head. The disc’s outer edge is ringed with an oval of soft, fleshy tissue. This lip makes contact with the surface of a host, whether it is a rough-skinned shark or a smooth dolphin. The lip conforms closely to the surface and begins to create a leakproof seal. Water is pumped out of the interior cavity to create a pressure difference inside and outside the seal. Higher water pressure outside just pushes harder against the seal. That’s the basic suction that holds the remora in place.\n\nBut a closer look at the fleshy tissue reveals an additional reinforcing feature. Just under the tissue’s surface is a layer that is densely filled with long, thin, vertically aligned fibers of collagen, a protein that is both strong and elastic. The fibers compress easily but resist stretching and breaking. Those properties help the lip maximize contact with surfaces to protect the seal. They also keep the lip from easily creeping or slipping when a remora’s host speeds up or changes direction suddenly.\n\nThe interior of the disc is lined with 10 to 30 thin, flat layers of tissue, aligned in two columns of parallel rows, like oars on a Roman galley or the ridges on the roof of your mouth. These are called lamellae, and remoras can raise them up to make more contact with their hosts and enhance suction.\n\nThe lamellae are embedded with many rows of spiky mineral structures called spinules, each a few millimeters tall. Remoras position their lamellae so that the spinules grip into the tiny crevices on the surface of the host. That generates friction that deters slippage. Spinules have a variety of tip ends, increasing the likelihood that at least some spinules are suitably shaped to gain traction on the particular surface available at that time.\nReleasing the lamellae then allows remoras to detach whenever and wherever they desire.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFishermen throughout the tropics have made use of this suction capability. They catch and tether remoras, then place them into the water near larger prey. When the remoras attach, the fishermen reel them both in together.\n\nBeyond this direct use, the structure of remoras’ suction disc offers blueprints for an engineering holy grail: finding a way to get things to adhere quickly, reliably, and reversibly, especially in watery environments. Ongoing research on remora discs could lead to new technologies and nontoxic, waterproof, easily removable adhesives that can be used on construction, clothing, outdoor gear, and beverage packaging, for example.\n\nScientists have already designed remora-inspired underwater robotic devices that allow them to hitchhike effectively, reducing their energy demands and prolonging their ability to stay under water. Similar devices could result in no-harm tags to observe marine animals and lead to breakthroughs in knowledge about the ocean."}, {"Source": "male bee's foreleg", "Application": "design inspired by bees", "Function1": "spread scent", "Function2": "collect oil", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/forelegs-are-used-to-spread-scent/", "Strategy": "Forelegs Are Used to Spread Scent\n\nMale bees use their forelegs to send mating signals and spread their scent. \n\nDifferences in the forelegs of bees are often a secondary sexual characteristic that affects male bees and plays a role in their chances of finding a mate.\n\nForelegs can be used to cover the females eyes as they mate. The different shapes and sizes of the forelegs between species cause different shadows and patterns of light to shine through as he covers her eyes. These patterns signal to the female bee that she is mating with her own species.\n\nForelegs are also used to collect scent, whether the scent is excreted as a pheromone (such as can happen in Leaf-cutter bees) or collected from a series of flowers (such as in Orchid bees). This scent is then used as a signal to attract a mate and to assure her that they are the same species. When secreting pheromones, the scent can also be used to distinguish the relationship between the female and her mate, to assure that they are not closely related. The forelegs can also come equipped with dense, soft hair to massage the sent into her antennae.\n\nThe forelegs can also be modified to collect oil from flowers in addition to pollen, though this is not a male-specific trait.

The front two pairs are situated in front of the spider’s center of mass, and the rear two pairs are behind its center of mass. During forward motion, the front two pairs flex inward, creating a rearward pulling force.  The third leg pair acts as a pivot point, like a pole vaulter using the pole to swing their momentum over the bar. The fourth leg pairs extend from hydraulic pressure creating a rearward push force.\n\nEach leg consists of seven tubular sections with three distinct regions. The hip joint located at the body allows movement left and right as well as up and down while the other two active elements, femur-patella, and tibia-metatarsus, allow movement up and down only. The hip joint has both extension muscles to push out the legs and flex muscles to pull in the legs.  The femur-patella and tibia-metatarsus only have flex muscles. To extend the legs, hemolymph fluid, similar to blood in vertebrates, pumped from the spider’s body fills the lower side of the femur-patella and tibia-metatarsus joints, pressurizing a bellow-like structure to extend the leg. With flex-only muscles attached to the inside circumference of the spider’s body, the spider can maximize its grip on prey. As a liquid, the hemolymph can fill in the gaps between muscle fibers for an efficient extension as well as leg structure stiffening.\n\nWhen the spider prepares to jump on its prey or away from danger, it pressurizes the legs for an extension while simultaneously flexing its muscles in place. When the spider relaxes its flexed muscles, the pressurized legs extend initiating the jump sequence.

Inside each fruit is a series of chambers filled with viscous sap and seeds. As the fruit ripens, the chambers fill with more and more sap, reaching pressures of about 27 atmospheres. Simultaneously, abscission tissue develops where the fruit is joined to the stem. Abscission tissue is a weak fracture point that allows parts of a plant to fall off without leaving open tissue that might get infected. When the pressure inside the fruit exceeds the strength of the abscission tissue around the stem, the fruit falls off, leaving a small hole at the top where the stem was attached. As it falls, the pressure forces the sap out of the hole at the top, carrying the seeds with it.

Insects, on the other hand, are able to use both their upstroke and downstroke to create lift because they are able to twist their wings at their flexible joints, which increases their aerodynamic efficiency. Most birds are unable to do this because their muscle and skeletal joints are configured to allow a repeatable back and forth motion.

Spores are usually single-celled and can grow into a new organism without requiring fertilization. Like plants, fungi need to disperse their spores in order to colonize new locations. Spores are very light and can be carried large distances by air currents. However, fungal fruiting bodies from which spores are dispersed are small and usually grow in low sheltered spots. In order to reach air currents, fungi distribute spores in a number of different ways. Some rely on wind or rain droplets to dislodge spores, while others, such as Pilobolus, are capable of shooting their spores distances of up to 2.5 meters.\nThe Basidiomycota are one large sub-division of the kingdom Fungi, comprising more than 30,000 known species. Basidiomycota have diverse methods for dispersing spores and one common mechanism is a ballistospore. Ballistospores are crescent shaped single spores that grow from the tips of specialized spore-producing structures called sterigma. Once mature, ballistospores spontaneous launch from the fruiting body at velocities of 1.2 metres per second, achieving 12000 g.\n\nThe mechanism of ballistospore launch is passive and makes use of air humidity and the natural behavior of water. Each ballistospore has two hygroscopic (water absorbing) patches on its surface. The patches are coated with sugars, including mannitol, that absorb water from the air and guide formation of two droplets on the spore’s surface. The patches are separated by a hydrophobic strip that prevents the drops from merging until they reach a critical size. Once they are large enough, the two drops make contact and merge. This merging causes the water to spread over the surface of the spore, changing its center of gravity and releasing energy from the altered water surface tension. The energy from the moving water enables the ballistospores to “jump” off the sterigma.\n\nFungi produce countless spores and, in an interesting addendum, ballistospores may have a far wider impact than simple fungal reproduction. After launch, the thin layer of water quickly evaporates, leaving the mannitol that had been concentrated in two precise locations spread over the entire surface of the spore. The fungi that produce ballistospores live primarily in forests, and this means the air above forests contains large numbers of aerial ballistospores. The mannitol coating the spore surface maintains its hygroscopic nature and continues to absorb moisture from the atmosphere over the trees. One theory suggests that this action could seed cloud formation and lead to increased rainfall over densely wooded areas."}, {"Source": "sea urchin's egg and sperm", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "slow down dilution", "Function2": "enhance fertilization rate", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/viscous-eggs-and-sperm-may-slow-down-dilution/", "Strategy": "Viscous Eggs and Sperm\nMay Slow Down Dilution\n\nViscous eggs and sperm from sea urchins may slow down dilution and enhance fertilization rates by forming sticky clumps.\n\nSea urchins are spiny marine animals that reproduce through broadcast spawning: they gather together into groups where females release millions of eggs and males release billions of sperm into the open water where the two can mix, potentially meet, and fertilize.\n\nThe exact conditions that trigger spawning in different urchin species are as yet unknown, but environmental cues like water temperature and food availability appear to play a role in triggering group spawning in some urchin populations.\n\nOnce released from the urchin’s body, sperm and eggs are at the whim of the surrounding water and its motion. If they become too diluted from dispersing too rapidly and widely, the chance of fertilization could decrease dramatically. Some species of sea urchins appear to have strategies that can help control dispersion of eggs and sperm and potentially make fertilization more likely. For instance, the eggs and sperm are negatively buoyant, meaning they tend to sink. This may prevent them from being swept away too quickly when first released.\n\nIn addition, the eggs and sperm have high viscosity. This property affects how much substances stay together or disperse: high viscosity substances tend to stick together (e.g., glue or molasses), while low viscosity substances flow and separate easily. Because of their high viscosity, urchin eggs and sperm can form concentrated clumps or sticky strings that stay close to the urchin and gradually diffuse over time. This could increase the chance that sperm and eggs encounter each other. Furthermore, this viscosity can change depending on how masses of sperm or eggs flow. When flow speeds within a flowing stream of sperm or eggs vary greatly (which can happen when fluids travel through a narrow pipe, for example), their viscosity decreases. This behavior is called shear-thinning. For an urchin, having eggs or sperm be less viscous while they travel through a reproductive duct and out an external pore could mean that less energy is needed to expel the eggs or sperm from its body.\n\n"}, {"Source": "australian green tree frog's toe pad", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "stick to various surfaces", "Function2": "maintain clean and functional toe pads", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/toe-pads-adhere-and-clean-themselves/", "Strategy": "Toe Pads Adhere and Clean Themselves\n\nThe feet of the Australian green tree frog stick to surfaces and stay clean due to mucus secreted between the toe pads\n\nAustralian tree frogs are able to climb a variety of surfaces with the help of their sticky toes.

Their paddle-like hind legs enable them to swim through the water, and in males, enlarged and adhesive sections of the forelegs enable them to attach temporarily to the backs of female beetles during courtship. Like many insects, diving beetles use small projecting structures called setae on their legs to aid in adhesion. In terrestrial insects, these setae are often hair-like structures. In male diving beetles, however, the adhesive setae are modified into spatula or suction-cup-like shapes that can function underwater.\n\nEach spatula-shaped seta on the diving beetle Cybister rugosus has a thin contact surface and a stalk. The contact surface is a ~400 µm-long, roughly oval-shaped pad with a small sucker and a series of parallel grooves running lengthwise on the underside. The short, flexible stalk connects the pad to the foreleg. These structures contribute to several mechanisms for effective and easily reversible underwater attachment. The small sucker on the pad likely functions as a suction cup, while the grooves can fill with water and adhere to a surface through viscous resistance. This is resistance to fluid flow due to the internal stickiness (viscosity) of water on a small scale, and would prevent the seta from slipping off a wet surface. The setal stalk is flexible and can twist to reorient the pad so that its water-filled grooves line up with exerted forces and enhance adhesion.\n\nFinally, the setae can easily detach because adhesion is velocity-dependent, meaning the speed with which setae contact a surface can affect the strength of adhesion. Adhesion is stronger if movement between the seta and surface is fast. This might occur when a male diving beetle is holding onto a female beetle that is swimming erratically. Adhesion is weaker, though, if movement is slow, making it easier for the foreleg to detach if the setae are peeled off slowly."}, {"Source": "snake scale", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "move over a variety of surfaces", "Function2": "high level of friction", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/scale-shape-enables-limbless-movement/", "Strategy": "Scale Shape Enables Limbless Movement\n\nScales of snakes enable limbless forward movement through directional friction.\n\nSnakes are limbless animals and so must move over a variety of surfaces using only their flexible and slender bodies. During typical slithering movements, a large portion of a snake’s body is in contact with and sliding over the ground at all times. This causes friction, which can damage the animal’s skin. In order to manage this friction, snake scales have a number of features that increase slipperiness. The scales on the underside of the snake are smoother than those on the sides and back, and they may also release a lubricant. However, in order to move, snakes must be able to grip the surface they are travelling across and push against it. In order to do this, they require a high level of friction between their scales and the surface: snakes must generate both low and high friction during travel.\n\nStudies on a variety of different snake species have demonstrated that the friction generated by sliding depends on the direction of travel. Belly scales have small “micropatterns” that create arrays of v-shaped feathered trailing edges. The tips of these v-shapes point towards the tail of the snake and, in some species, they are raised at the tip. In this way, as the snake slides, the surface moves easily up and over the raised tips, but in the reverse direction they act like the pawl of a ratchet, snagging the surface and resisting movement in the opposite direction. The scales also have series of parallel grooves running from the head of the snake towards its tail. These grooves work like rails, limiting surface contact area and friction as long as the snake in moving in a parallel direction to the grooves, but generating high friction and grip when the snake moves sideways.

Antibodies have to recognize and bind a diversity of pathogens in a lifetime, and the immune system can produce billions of different antibodies to accomplish this.\n\nThe surface molecules that antibodies bind to on pathogens are called antigens, and binding between antibody and antigen is highly specific. A given antibody can fit with and bind only one or a few different antigens. Each antibody is a Y-shaped molecule with two binding sites, one on each tip of the Y’s upper arms. While the majority of the molecule is similar among different antibodies, the binding sites at the tips are highly variable. Different numbers and combinations of protein building blocks (amino acids) result in different protein folding patterns at the binding site. How the proteins are folded determines the specific 3D shape and chemical characteristics at the antibody’s binding site. This binding site attaches to antigens like a lock fits a key. Many weak bonds between the binding site and the antigen enable the antibody to attach tightly.\n\nBy keeping the basic structure of the antibody consistent and only altering the binding site in response to different antigens, the immune system can produce a myriad of antibodies to combat diverse pathogens. Furthermore, antibodies can form complexes, where their multiple binding sites attach to and bring together many antigen-bearing pathogens. This helps to localize an infection and makes it easier for other parts of the immune system to respond."}, {"Source": "platypus's front feet", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "provide paddling power", "Function2": "extend webbing", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/feet-paddle-efficiently/", "Strategy": "Feet Paddle Efficiently\n\nThe front feet of a platypus provide exceptional paddling power thanks to extensive webbing.\n\n“The rear toes [of the platypus] are webbed like those of a duck; but the front feet are unique.

Stability and maneuverability in swimming tend to have competing requirements. Stability often involves a narrow range of movements, like a tuna whipping its tail back and forth while cruising through the open ocean. Maneuverability, on the other hand, involves a wide range of movements like tight turns and changes in posture. Being highly stable often means being less adept at maneuvering, and vice versa. Researchers studying boxfishes have looked at how water flows around their bodies to determine how stability and maneuverability play roles in their swimming behavior.\n\nProjecting from the boxfish’s carapace (its bony outer covering) are ridges and edges that affect how water flows around its body. In an early set of experiments, researchers found that these ridges appeared to manipulate the flow so that it produced stabilizing forces during swimming. In a later study using different methods, other researchers found that the flows around the ridges and body should destabilize the body overall. Although this might seem undesirable, destabilization actually enables a much wider range of movement than if the boxfish were trying to remain constantly stable. In this latter case, the boxfish can  use the pectoral fins at its side and tail fin to control this destabilization and ultimately be highly maneuverable in the water. Additional research could help uncover exactly how the boxfish’s body and fins work together to affect stability and maneuverability as it navigates its complex environment. \n\n"}, {"Source": "garden nasturtium's leaf", "Application": "textured surface", "Function1": "reduce contact time", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaf-ridges-reduce-contact-time-with-water-drops/", "Strategy": "Leaf Ridges Reduce Contact\nTime With Water Drops\n\nRidges on garden nasturtium leaves reduce contact time with water drops by enabling faster drop recoil.\n\nMany plants have hydrophobic (water repellent) leaves. When raindrops fall on these surfaces, they tend to bounce off, and the less time a liquid drop spends in contact with a surface, the lower the likelihood that it will stick and leave some moisture behind.\n\nGarden nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), a common backyard garden plant, has leaves that appear to reduce the contact time of incoming liquid drops by altering drop hydrodynamics with a “macrotextured” surface of relatively large veins and ridges.\n\nOn most smooth or microtextured surfaces, incoming drops hit the surface and then experience “axisymmetric recoil”: the drop spreads out into a pancake shape with uniform thickness, and then bounces back up, recoiling with a roughly circular shape and uniform speed around its edges. The center of the spread out drop is static, and has little role in the recoil. On surfaces with macrotexture (up to 150 microns high) ridges and veins, like nasturtium leaves, if a drop hits a ridge, it experiences “center-assisted recoil” instead. The ridge alters the behavior of the drop so that it recoils in an asymmetrical shape, and the liquid in the center of each spread out region contributes to recoil. This is possible because the liquid layer above the ridge is thinner than elsewhere on the surface, so it has less liquid to accelerate back up and recoils faster than other parts of the drop. This non-uniform recoil speed within the drop tends to make it fragment, resulting in small, connected fractions that recoil more quickly. In addition, more of the drop contributes to recoil than would be the case with one big mass of water.\n\nWhether or not reduced drop contact time gives the nasturtium plant any functional benefit has yet to be determined, but researchers who have developed and tested synthetic surfaces with macrotextures have demonstrated similar effects.

Dynein is a large protein that pairs up with a second copy of itself to look very much like a pair of legs. At the end of each leg are “feet” that bind to the microtubule track, while the cargo is tethered to the other end. Dynein uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell, to power each step and staggers its way along the track dragging the cargo behind it.\n\nWhen carrying a small or intermediate cargo, dynein proceeds along the track somewhat randomly. The molecule’s feet are lightly bound and they might step forwards or backwards, or even let go entirely. Taken together, on average, dynein molecules are more likely to move forwards than back, and so the cargo gets carried in the right direction. Transport via this method is exceedingly slow, however this doesn’t matter as the distances traveled are exceedingly small.\n\nWhen carrying a large cargo, there is a heavier load on the stalk tethering the load. This might be expected to make the dynein more likely to let go of the track, however, the tension on the stalk causes the molecule to change shape, gripping the track more tightly.

These threads form an orb web’s sticky prey capture spiral, which retains insects that strike the web, providing a spider with more time to locate and subdue their prey. Viscous threads are comprised of small, regularly spaced aqueous droplets that surround a pair of supporting axial fibers and are produced by a triad of spigots on each of a spider’s paired posterior spinnerets. The single flagelliform gland spigot of this triad produces an axial fiber and is flanked by two aggregate gland spigots, which coat this fiber with aqueous material. The coated axial fibers merge to form a contiguous pair of fibers surrounded initially by a sheath of viscous material. As a thread absorbs atmospheric moisture in the high humidity of the early morning hours, this material quickly condenses into a regular series of droplets whose size and spacing differ greatly among species.\n\n“The glycoprotein within each droplet that confers thread adhesion is encoded by two genes. The asg1 gene produces a 406-amino-acid protein, whose upstream region has a high proportion of charged amino acids, which are considered hydrophilic, and its repeating downstream region is similar to mucin, known to have adhesive properties. The asg2 gene produces a 714-amino-acid protein, whose upstream region is similar to known chitin-binding proteins, adapting it to adhere to insect exoskeleton, whereas its repeating downstream region has high proline content that resembles that of elastin and flagelliform spider silk, making it elastic.

These nerve cells can detect small deflections in the whisker as it physically interacts with its surroundings, relaying this information to the brain. The harbor seal, and other aquatic mammals, can even sense and analyze changes in water flow caused by prey fish or other seals.

Remarkably, harbor seals accomplish this with the unique form of their sensitive whiskers.\n\nTaking a closer look at harbor seal whiskers shows that they have an undulating or wavy surface structure. The cross section of the whisker is an ellipse, but the size of it changes along the hair. This creates peaks and troughs every 1-3 mm along the hair. Normally, dragging a bluff object like a whisker through water creates vortices, or swirls of water, that would vibrate the whisker as they trailed off behind it. However, the shape of the whisker on its leading edge alters the flow of water over and behind the whisker as the seal swims. The whisker’s wavy leading edge creates a trail of swirling water behind the whisker (also called the wake) with equal pressure on either side and a gap between the whisker and vortices. This significantly lowers forces on the whisker and thus prevents vortex-induced vibrations. Having the whiskers as still as possible, even when swimming, enables harbor seals to sense small changes in water movement.

Reaching through the interior of the shell is a tubular structure called the siphuncle. The nautilus uses this organ to control the volumes of water and gases within each of its shell chambers to regulate its buoyancy.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe movement of water into and out of the chambers is driven by osmosis, resulting from changes in the concentration of ions within the chamber fluid. Ions are actively pumped back and forth between chambers to control the movement of the fluids in the chamber. Pumping ions, usually sodium and chloride, out of a chamber makes the fluid within the chamber more dilute (more watery). This causes water to diffuse out of the chamber through the siphuncle in order to equalize the gradient.\n\nThe Potential \n\nMuch like the Nautilus, submarines use ballast tanks to control their buoyancy by filling them with either air (to surface) or water (to submerge). The Nautilus’s unique strategy of using osmosis gradients to move water and modulate buoyancy could have applications for new types of underwater vehicles for transportation, surveillance, and research. Smart buoys could also sense incoming traffic and submerge until boats cleared them.\n\n"}, {"Source": "dolphin's body", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "reduce friction", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/body-shape-reduces-friction/", "Strategy": "Body Shape Reduces Friction\n\nThe body of the dolphin has low friction in water by having an optimal length to diameter ratio.\n\n“The streamlined body of optimal shape has a length of 4.5 times its diameter.

It’s neither a cheap nor a rapid way to go, a slug being the very paradigm of sluggishness. It is (or, strictly, was) a mysterious business. Slugs use neither cilia (as push the mucus lining our respiratory passages) nor peristaltic motion (as do, for instance, earthworms). How they propel themselves turns out to depend on that mucus, in particular on viscoelastic behavior more complex than anything we’ve seen so far.\n\nThe key can be seen if, with just the right lighting, one watches from beneath while a slug walks across a glass surface. Some kind of waves pass lengthwise; they’re about a millimeter or so in wavelength and travel at a couple of millimeters per second (fig. 17.7). It certainly looks as if the slug gets around by pushing back on its mucus, and that’s indeed what it does. But consider–that will work for one ‘step’ only. Any operating system that pushes needs to recover if it’s to push again…At strains above 5 or 6 (higher values at higher strain rates), the mucus abruptly yields, transforming in a flash into a gooey liquid with a viscosity of 3-5 pascal-seconds–three thousand to five thousand times the viscosity of pure water. Stress falls abruptly, dropping by half, and the stress-strain curve goes flat and horizontal–stress now depends only on strain rate, as befits a fluid. Thus, the mucus can be pushed upon, propelling the slug forward, but when nudged just beyond that yield stress it turns to liquid. Then a bit of slug can slide forward across it and be ready to push backward again. Meanwhile, and critically, the mucus has to recover, to ‘heal’ back into a viscoelastic solid, which it obligingly does forthwith. In life, a ‘step’ is about a millimeter in length and the mucus layer is about 10 micrometers thick, so the strain gets up to around 100 during the recovery phase of each pedal wave. Beneath a given slug at a given time, all stages of the operation are taking place, with mucus in different states under different points along the animal.

It also might serve as a model for artificial systems that concentrate pollutants in a collection space, making them relatively easy to remove or process into less harmful molecules.\n\n"}, {"Source": "sycamore maple seed", "Application": "designs of drones and ceiling fans", "Function1": "self-orientation", "Function2": "autorotation", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/seedpod-autorotates/", "Strategy": "Seedpod Spirals to Stay Aloft\n\nSeed shape and distribution of mass ensure self-orientation and autorotation.\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), a large, spreading broadleaf tree growing to 115 feet (35 meters), has a deep, branched root system that provides stability in high winds. But maple trees aren’t just good at resisting the wind, they’re also ingenious in how they use it.\n\nThe trees produce winged seeds which spin as they fall. These are sometimes known as helicopter seeds or samaras, and similarly-behaving seeds have evolved in other plant species many times. No matter the orientation of the seed as it detaches from the tree, it quickly self-orients and begins autorotating. This slows the seed’s descent to the ground, giving the seed more chance to be carried away by a passing breeze.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nHow do sycamore maple seeds orient themselves and start spinning? It’s a balancing act. The seedhead (or achene) is heavier than the seed’s wing, while the wing is much broader, catching more air as the seed falls. In physics terms, the center of mass is different from the center of pressure.\n\nAs the seedhead falls slightly in advance of the wing, and the broadest part of the wing slows due to air resistance, the wing is forced to tilt with respect to the ground. As air rushes upward and encounters the tilted wing, it deflects away from the seed at an angle, pushing the wing in the opposite direction.\n\nThe falling seedhead, meanwhile, encountering little air resistance over its compact body, descends straight downward, functioning like an axle around which the wing now begins spinning. Gravity provides a steady diet of air as the seed continues to fall, while the rotating wing, resisting a quick return to Earth, keeps the opportunity alive for a passing breeze to shove the seed on a lateral journey, farther away from the mother tree.\n\nThe Potential \n\nSamaras have already inspired new designs of drones and ceiling fans.

They can quickly change direction and even run headfirst down trees by swiveling their back ankle joints. At the same time, well-developed claws in both the front and hind feet dig into the substrate as anchor points.\n\nFriction-based grip suffices on small tree branches. This is because the squirrel is light, and forces applied by the pads of its paws are at a wide enough angle that friction overcomes the competing downward force of gravity. As a tree branch or trunk gets thicker, however, the squirrel cannot reach around to get this same grip, and friction is not enough to keep from falling. At this point, the squirrel’s claws contribute to its ability to cling to structures that have a wide diameter.\n\nWhile it seems intuitive that a squirrel’s small size contributes to its agility, its claws also play a critical role as the animal traverses all the possible angles of a tree. As a squirrel moves in various directions on different surfaces, gravity interacts with its actual mass. To prevent falling, the squirrel must keep its mass oriented in a way to counter this downward force: a process known as finding its center of gravity. All forces associated with the squirrel’s weight and its position must be balanced. The squirrel’s sharp claws help by evenly distributing mass across the various diameters of the climbing surface.\n\nUpon digging into a surface, the force of gravity shifts from the squirrel’s paw pads to the underside of its claws. If the surface is porous enough to embed its claws at an angle of 90 degrees or greater, the squirrel can ensure a successful grip and evenly distribute its mass across its claws. This is true at any orientation–whether the squirrel is moving up, down, sideways, or at an angle across the surface. This, in turn, keeps the squirrel’s center of gravity close to the tree, preventing the squirrel from falling.\n\nSquirrels can quickly respond to the challenges they encounter as they move through wooded areas by instantly changing direction. This is a function of their claws’ ability to shift their weight to find the center of gravity, and a wide range of motion offered by their uniquely rotating back ankles. With these adaptations, squirrels are secure with only two points of attachment, whereas humans need no less than three as they climb. Because of this, squirrels can swing from their swiveling back feet while grabbing onto new surfaces at angles that would be impossible for most animals.\n\nIn essence, squirrels can deftly hug porous surfaces close enough to keep from sliding down or falling due to gravity.

As the name suggests, the bill is long with a wider rounded end. Spoonbills catch their food in shallow water, where they eat fish, crustaceans, and insects that can be floating in the water or on the muddy bottom. Like many birds, the spoonbill uses its bill to grasp directly at prey that is visible and within reach; however, it also appears to have a strategy for drawing prey that it might not even see closer.\nAs the spoonbill walks through shallow water, it dips its head down and sweeps its bill from side to side in an arc through the water. The top of the bill is rounded while the bottom is nearly flat. In cross section, this shape is called a hydrofoil (or airfoil if it moves through air–more commonly known as a wing). As a hydrofoil moves through the water, water flowing over the rounded top of the hydrofoil travels faster than water flowing under the flatter bottom. This occurs because the water has to meet at the end of the hydrofoil at the same time (law of conservation of mass). This difference in flow speeds above and below the hydrofoil generates an upward force much like an airplane wing generates lift in air. At the same time, the difference in flow results in areas of swirling water at the tips of the hydrofoil. This swirling water is called a tip vortex, and it’s what researchers believe the spoonbill uses to gather prey.\nAs the spoonbill’s hydrofoil-shaped bill sweeps through the water, it generates a force and a bill-tip vortex. This vortex can stir up and draw small prey off the bottom of the shallow water or stimulate mobile prey to move in the water column. Once near the spoonbill’s mouth, it can then sense and capture the prey with its bill.\n\n"}, {"Source": "whirligig beetle's leg", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "increase the total surface area", "Function2": "maximize efficiency", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hair-extension-and-folding-prevents-speed-loss/", "Strategy": "Hair Extension and Folding Prevents Speed Loss\n\nHairs on the whirligig beetle's mid and hind legs prevent loss of speed by extending and folding during swimming strokes.\nThe mid legs and hind legs of the whirligig beetle contain numerous microscopic hairs (called laminae) that increase surface area while swimming, resulting in greater thrust and power.

In birds flying in formation, each wing moves in an upwash field that is generated by the wings of the other birds in the formation. Modelling has shown that when birds are flying with optimal spacing, a maximal reduction in power can be achieved and total transport costs can be substantially reduced. However, field observations of V formations indicate that birds often shift from their optimal positioning, perhaps in an attempt to maximize the aerodynamic advantage of flight formation, thus reducing the energy saving— so geese, for example, may make an energy saving of only 2.4%.\n\n“In our study, pelicans often had difficulty staying within the formation, particularly when flying at the rear. But even though these birds were regularly adjusting their position, they still achieved a significant energy saving. This saving may be only partly due to effects of the wakes of other birds on the power input that results from formation flight itself. When flying in formation, pelicans appear to beat their wings less frequently and to glide for longer periods. A rough calculation based on our estimates of the proportion of time spent flapping and gliding in formation, and assuming that the overall costs of the glide–flap sequence is the sum of the gliding and flapping components, reveals an actual saving of 1.7–3.4% as a result of wake effects on power input — this value is comparable to that estimated for geese.\n\n“The main benefit of flight formation, which until now has not been recognized, could be that by flying in a vortex wake, pelicans are able to glide for a greater proportion of their total flight time, with the total energy savings of 11.4–14.0% being achieved primarily through this strategy.” "}, {"Source": "seals' fur and penguins' feathers", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "get a grip", "Function2": "help climb ice floes", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fur-and-feathers-get-grip-on-ice/", "Strategy": "Fur and Feathers Get Grip on Ice\n\nFur and feathers of seals and penguins help them get a grip to climb ice floes and snow thanks to their stiffness.\n“For the seals of the icy seas and the penguins of the antarctic shore this gliding and braking mechanism is vital.

At great heights it grows pods that contain hundreds of winged seeds called samara. As the wind blows against the opening of the pods, the samara are peeled away and released. Unlike many seeds that make a gliding flight using auto-rotation, the seed of the Javan cucumber vine exhibits a stable gliding flight with its paper-thin wings. The seed’s design is efficient enough to achieve a low descent angle of only 12 degrees and therefore it is able to achieve a slower rate of descent (0.41 meter per second) compared to that of rotating winged seeds (1 meter per second). This aerodynamic advantage allows the seed to be easily carried by the wind.\n\nThe construction of the seed and wing gives it this advantage. The seed itself is thin, about 1 millimeter in thickness, and positioned almost exactly at the structure’s center of gravity to give it balance. The wings are even thinner, about a few micrometer to some 10 micrometer. Because the wings are so thin, as the samara is angled up or down, the center of pressure from the wind will shift to reduce that angle. This effect stabilizes the seed and also prevents it from diving. When viewed from above, the wings are angled behind the center of the seed to give it more stability and are slightly tapered toward the tip to make it lighter with less drag. When viewed from the front, the wings are angled upward which helps it fly in a straighter path and prevents spiral instability. The wings also have a sharp leading edge and an aspect ratio (AR=3~4) that results in an appropriate lift-to-drag ratio (L/D= 3~4) to support their gliding flight.\n\nThe form of the samara allows it to travel long distances in the wind. It is possible for the seeds to glide up to hundreds of meters, ensuring that they spread far from each other as well as the parent pod.

He noticed that the legs slowly slide centripetally across the glass, periodically detaching and swinging outward again.

Many primitive invertebrate swimmers use this kind of locomotion. In many aquatic animals (lampreys, eels), wriggling is aided by vertical stabilizer fins that extend the sides of the body and thus facilitate power transmission to the water. Cat sharks, some true sharks, lungfish, and sturgeon also swim with this lateral slithering motion. How efficient and energy-saving this method of locomotion is can best be seen by taking a look at the eels, which cover thousands of kilometers on their wanderings through the oceans. Slow-motion pictures of their movements disclose the principles of physics on which they are based. The essential prerequisite for getting ahead by wriggling through the water is for the body wave to travel rearward faster than the fish travels forward. The wriggling animal thereby exerts pressure on the water along the wave loops moving backward.

This adaptation does not occur in all bromeliads, but just those that grow in areas where there may be less access to nutrients (such as hanging on trees where they rely on nutrients dissolved in rainwater).\n\nThe leaves of these types of bromeliads have a convex shape, meaning that they form a curved arch away from the surface they grow on.

The edges of the leaf bend upward, creating a structure that looks like a miniature half-pipe. This water collection is helpful for the bromeliad because it enables the plant to collect life-sustaining nutrients from the standing water over a longer period of time.\n\nThe leaves of bromeliads are also coated in small surface cells that are raised like bumps, known as trichomes.

Shark skin is sturdier stuff than fish skins generally…and it has the crossed helical fiber array typical of these hydrostatic arrangements, shown in figure 20.5b. The system, though, is more complex than those described previously–muscles attach directly to the skin, which thus acts both as external, pressure-resisting membrane and as an external, whole-body tendon. Fiber angles, not unreasonably, vary with location on the fish–the unstretchy skin must transmit the forces generated by the body musculature back toward the tail. During locomotion, the pressure inside the body of a shark rises to as much as 200 kilopascals–twice atmospheric and as high as that inside an automobile tire. So sharks are just shark-shaped balloons with teeth.\n\n“In sharks, the peculiar resistance of crossed helical fibers to torsion may have functional significance, at least of a negative kind. Sharks lack swimbladders and thus sink if inactive. Swimming must produce a little lift in addition to thrust, and a shark gets that lift, in part, by beating a tail fin that extends farther dorsally than ventrally, as you can see in the figure.

FimH is one of Salmonella’s multi-domain adhesive proteins. The binding domain is a lectin pocket that binds to mannose on the surface of the host cell. This domain is linked to another part of the adhesive protein (a long pilin domain) which anchors FimH to the bacteria. When the bonds between the bacteria and its host are pulled apart by weak forces, the pilin domain holds tightly to the binding domain which in turn binds mannose with low force. But when the bonds between the bacteria and its host are pulled apart by stonger forces, the pilin domain is stretched away from the binding domain causing the structure of the binding pocket to shift so that it binds mannose with 100 times more force.

These data were used to illustrate the grasping ability of locusts on slopes with varying levels of roughness.

The interaction between pads and substrates may improve the stability of contact, and claw tips may play a key role in keeping the attachment reliable. A model was developed to explain the significant effects of the relative size of claw tips and mean particle diameter on grasping ability as well as the observed increase in lateral force (2.09-4.05 times greater than the normal force during detachment) with increasing slope angle, which indicates that the lateral force may be extremely important in keeping the contact reliable.

At first glance they seem to be unlikely runners, with their huge egg-shaped torsos and skinny legs. However, these birds have evolved to run and manoeuvre at speed to shake off predators…while humans decelerate to prevent over-rotation, on average ostriches generate fewer deceleration forces. In individual cases the birds generated both acceleration and deceleration forces to control their body orientation, but these are reduced because of their body shape with its higher inertia…[The authors] found that as the leg hits the ground, the angle of the leg is very close to the angle of the force. This reduces the torque and produces similar forces to those recorded during straight running. So rather than twisting at the joints, the torque is maintained and ostriches change direction by simply rolling their body into the turn. It is this combination of body shape and behaviour that allows running ostriches to change direction so gracefully.”\n\n“Our analysis revealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrich occurs in flexion/extension. Importantly, however, the alignment of the average flexion/extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotated externally to the direction of travel (37 degrees and 21 degrees , respectively) so that pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct [sic] the tibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement, and pure flexion and extension at the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to the plane of movement. This feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide the major lateral (non-sagittal) displacement of the lower limb necessary for steering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what would otherwise require greater adduction/abduction and/or internal/external rotation, allowing for less complex joints, musculoskeletal geometry and neuromuscular control. Significant rotation about the joints’ non-flexion/extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride. In particular, hip abduction and knee internal/external and varus/valgus motion may further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase, and substantial non-flexion/extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance.”"}, {"Source": "banana slug's foot", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "facilitate transfer of adhesive force", "Function2": "transmit mechanical force", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/viscoelastic-mucus-enables-locomotion/", "Strategy": "Viscoelastic Mucus Enables Locomotion\n\nThe foot of a banana slug generates a propulsive force against surfaces via mucus secretions that act as both a lubricant and an adhesive.\nSnails and slugs only have one body part in contact with the ground at any one time, which raises the question: how do they develop a net force to produce propulsion? Most animals have multiple legs with some functioning as stationary supports while others move forward to act as future stationary supports. Initially, it may seem that using only one structure to both hold onto the ground and move over it is a paradox; however, snails and slugs evolved the answer long ago. Though the precise physical mechanism has yet to be revealed, snail and slug mucus is apparently used to both lubricate the snail’s movement over surfaces and to facilitate the transfer of adhesive force to the surface. Only a “viscoelastic” fluid could have both properties since ordinary fluids are either viscous or elastic. Snails and slugs move by producing a pedal wave that travels from one end of the body to the other (depending on the species of snail). The interwave regions are stationary (relative to the ground) and exert force against the mucus layer which is then transmitted to the ground; for the interwave region, the mucus acts as an elastic or adhesive material capable of transmitting mechanical force. On the other hand, wave regions travel over the ground and do not exert force on it; in this case, the mucus acts as a viscous lubricant.

Dyneins actively generate force when sliding in one direction is detected, and are inhibited from doing so by the detection of sliding in the other direction. The direction of the initial, passive sliding oscillates because it is regulated hydrodynamically by the direction of the propulsive thrust.

Furthermore, levels of nucleotide diversity for opsin gene functional sites were lower than those for 15 neutrally evolving intergenic regions (>25 kb in total), which is consistent with a history of purifying selection on aye-aye opsin genes. The most likely explanation for these findings is that dichromacy is advantageous for aye-ayes despite their nocturnal activity pattern. We speculate that dichromatic nocturnal primates may be able to perceive color while foraging under moonlight conditions, and suggest that behavioral and ecological comparisons among dichromatic and monochromatic nocturnal primates will help to elucidate the specific activities for which color vision perception is advantageous.”"}, {"Source": "mosquito's legs", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "float", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/scales-allow-floating/", "Strategy": "Scales Allow Floating\n\nLegs of mosquitoes allow it to float due to scales that structurally maximize trapping of air.\n“We found that the mosquito’s legs are covered by numerous scales consisting of the uniform microscale longitudinal ridges (nanoscale thickness and microscale spacing between) and nanoscale cross ribs (nanoscale thickness and spacing between).

Nematodes jump using a two-step process of forming and contracting a loop. During loop formation, the nematode bends the anterior half of its body until the head region makes contact with the side of the body. The two body regions are held fast by the surface tension of the water film covering the nematode. When the loop is contracted, the body becomes contorted so that the cuticle kinks.\n\nThis extreme bending generates and stores sufficient energy that when the surface-tension force is broken the nematode is propelled through the air. The nematode (0.558 mm in length) can jump a distance of 4.8 ± 0.8 mm (mean ± SEM) and a height of 3.9 ± 0.1 mm.

Unknown to scientists until as recently as 1958, and dwelling at depths of 330-3280 feet (100-1000 m), this slender pike-like fish has paired, downward-pointing, spherical organs housed within the lower half of its large eyes. These were once believed to be light-producing organs – bioluminescence is a common phenomenon among deep-sea fishes. Closer examination, however, exposed their much more extraordinary, true identity. In reality, these organs, now referred to as secondary globes, are accessory eyes.

The worms push hard, with radial forces running about seven times the anchoring forces involved in crawling in preexisting burrows or in resisting extraction by a robin. We noted that if membrane thickness remains constant, tolerable pressure (still assuming constant breaking stress) will vary inversely with radius. Pressure, of course, is force divided by area, and thus is proportional to force divided by radius and cylinder length. So outward force per unit body length should be independent of size or, put in the usual terms, it should scale with body mass to the zero power–F [is proportional to] Mb0.4. If, by contrast, membrane thickness scales with radius, then tolerable pressure remains constant. That implies that outward force should vary directly with radius or with body mass to the one-third–F [is proportional to] Mb0.33.\n\n“So what does happen? For earthworms ranging from 0.01 to 8 grams, Quillin found that F [is proportional to] Mb0.4, reasonably close to the assumptions of a thickness proportional to radius and constant material strength.

Both move rearward as the animal pushes, and the rearward drag of the unit generates the forward thrust. (Moving a dimple backwards forces water to move forwards, hence this nonobject has perfect ordinary drag.)”\n\n“Fishing spiders live throughout the United States, although they’re particularly abundant in the South. They lurk along the edges of ponds and streams, and when insects drop to the water, these spiders rush across the surface to attack. They can also dip their legs underwater and grab swimming tadpoles and small fish.\n\nThe first order of business for animals with this lifestyle is to stay on top of the water. Fishing spiders do so by taking advantage of surface tension. Water molecules are more attracted to one another than they are to molecules in the air. This molecular pull makes the surface of water act like a sheet of rubber. When a spider sets a leg on the water, a dimplelike depression forms around it, and the water pushes back up to regain a smooth surface… Although surface tension can keep fishing spiders afloat, it makes it hard for them to go anywhere. On land they can push their legs against solid ground, generating an opposing force that carries them forward.\n\nTheir waxy legs can’t get a purchase on the surface of the pond, however; the water is, in effect, too slippery to permit the spiders to move.\n\nBut move they do, and for the past few years Robert Suter, a biologist at Vassar College, has been studying just how they do it. What he has found is that the spiders row across the water’s surface by using the dimples their legs make in it. When a fishing spider moves one of its legs  from front to back, it draws that dimple back with it.\n\nAs the dimple moves, it acts like an oar, pushing against the surrounding water and creating a force that propels the spider forward. A fishing spider rows with the middle two of its four pairs of legs. First it swings back its third pair, then the second pair, and when both pairs are extended as far back as they can go, the spider raises them from the water and brings them forward again. Meanwhile, it keeps its front and rear pairs of legs motionless, using their surface tension to keep itself afloat while it prepares for the next stroke… There’s a limit to how fast fishing spiders can travel this way, however. To speed up, a spider can either make deeper dimples (giving itself bigger oars) or push them back faster.”"}, {"Source": "shark's tail", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent sinking", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/tail-prevents-sinking/", "Strategy": "Tail Prevents Sinking\n\nTails of sharks and sturgeons keep these heavy-bodied animals from sinking because they are assymetrical and produce an upward-directed torque.\n“A number of good swimmers among the shark and sturgeon families are heavier than water.

At 100 km/h, a slight gust, one wrong move, or rough seas could seal its fate. The secret was revealed by slow-motion photography: While diving, the gannet puts itself into a spin with a deliberate tail movement. The spin increases toward the point of impact as the bird lays back its wings like a figure skater bringing her arms close to her body. In a fast dive, this movement usually turns the body once or twice around its axis, acting like a gyroscopic stabilizer in a rocket. In the language of physics, the bird is kept on course by the conservation of angular momentum. This elegant mechanical stabilization notwithstanding, the moment of impact on the water surface is critical because of the powerful forces involved. But the gannet has been well primed by nature for this moment. Its body can stretch into an ideally streamlined spindle. Any unevenness about the head is eliminated.

Many flowering plants that grow under such conditions have adaptations that allow them to sequester their seeds in pods or other enclosures and release them only under wet conditions. This helps ensure they have the moisture they need to sprout when they fall while protecting them from seed-eating animals in the meantime.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nOne of the most remarkable of the organisms using this process is the true rose of Jericho (Anastatica hierochuntica). Found in northern Africa and western Asia, this annual flowering plant blooms and produces seeds during the wet season. But rather than releasing the seeds right away, it hangs on tight.\n\nAs the plant wilts and dies, its branches curl inward, forming a cage that tightly encases the seedpods. The seeds remain hidden—and avoid becoming a meal—until a reviving rainstorm arrives, months or even years later.\n\nWhen the rains finally do come, after about an hour of exposure, the moisture causes the branches to unfurl. In the new configuration, raindrops can dislodge and scatter the now-accessible seeds.\n\nHow does all of this happen? The secret, it turns out, has to do with the distribution of different kinds of cells in the branches of the plant. The side of the branch that faces down in the growing plant has a greater number and density of wider water-conducting conduits than the side that faces upward. As the plant withers at the end of the growing season, the upper side dries out more quickly than the lower side, causing the branches to curl upward. Alternatively, when rain comes and the dead plant tissue absorbs water through its stem, the denser and wider conduits on the lower side send water toward the tips of the branches faster and more efficiently, causing the branches to asymmetrically expand and unfurl.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe ability to change shape and function with the addition or removal of moisture has numerous potential applications to meet human needs both for using water and avoiding it. For example, it might be applied to deactivating an irrigation system when precipitation obviates the need for it, to opening new channels to keep excess water from flooding an area, or to deploying umbrella-like shelters to protect people or objects from rain. It could also be used to remotely detect the presence of moisture or to activate the release of drugs or other materials under specific conditions.\n\n"}, {"Source": "fly's olfactory system", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "detect decomposition", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/olfactory-system-detects-decomposition/", "Strategy": "Olfactory System Detects Decomposition\n\nThe olfactory systems of some flies help them find food due to their extreme sensitivity to the smell of rotting meat.\n“The sense of smell is vital to most insects for finding food.

A grotesquely large species, the intestinal parasite Ascaris, was studied by Harris and Crofton (1957). Ascaris has a normal fiber angle of about 75 degrees; being unflattened, it lives just on the curve of figure 20.2, part way down the left-hand slope. Contraction of its muscles can only shorten it further. But shortening can only happen if it decreases in volume to move down the slope, which it can’t, or if the fibers stretch, which they do very little. Mainly, muscle contraction makes it much stiffer, generating internal pressures up to 30 kilopascals–around a third of an atmosphere. The hypertensive worms do get shorter, but only by about 10 percent. Nematodes can bend by contracting muscles on one side only; and this, too, increases internal pressure. Circumferential muscles are quite superfluous–the resilience of the cuticle antagonizes the action of the longitudinals.

Blubber is a pliant biocomposite formed by adipocytes and structural fibers composed of collagen and elastic fibers. Caudal keels are dorsally and ventrally placed triangular wedges of blubber that define the hydrodynamic profile of the porpoise tail-stock. Mechanical tests on carcasses demonstrate that when keels are bent, they strain nonuniformly along their lengths, with highest strains just caudal to the dorsal fin and lowest at the insertion of the flukes. Therefore, caudal keels undergo nonuniform longitudinal deformation while maintaining a stable, triangular cross-sectional shape. Polarizing and transmitted light microscopy techniques were used to investigate blubber’s 3D fiber architecture along the length of the dorsal keel. The triangular cross-sectional shape of the keel appears to be maintained by structural fibers oriented to act as tensile stays. The construction of the blubber composite is regionally specific: structural fiber densities and diameters are higher in the relatively stiff caudal region of the keel than in the more deformable cranial keel region. The orientations of structural fibers also change along the length of the keel. Cranially, no fibers are oriented along the long axis, whereas a novel population of longitudinally oriented fibers reinforces the keel at the insertion of the flukes.

If the swimming muscles force the bell at its resonant frequency, as opposed to a single contraction at the same rate of deformation, the amplitude of the oscillation will be increased by about 40%, and the energetic requirement for the cycle will be reduced by about 24-37% of the total cost of the cycle. The advantages of forcing the structure at its resonant frequency seem quite remarkable.”"}, {"Source": "seal's fur", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "maintain laminar flow", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fur-decreases-water-turbulence/", "Strategy": "Fur Decreases Water Turbulence\n\nThe fur of seals may help them swim efficiently by maintaining laminar flow.\n“…the short wiry hair or feather coats of such good swimmers as seals and penguins seem to be a great advantage for the maintenance of laminar flows.

Normally these worms form severely flattened cylinders; the fibers in their surface layers lie at angles to their long axes somewhere in the 40-70 degree range. Since they’re not circular cylinders, they contain less volume than they might, and they live beneath the curve of figure 20.2, in the region labeled ‘flaccid.’ If such a worm contracts longitudinal muscles it will get shorter, moving to the left along a horizontal line. Sufficient contraction will bring it up against the curve, where it finds itself circular in section and more turgid to boot. If the worm contracts circumferential muscles it gets longer, moving to the right, but again it gets more nearly circular and more turgid.

On the ground, females flash in response, attracting the males for a reproductive rendezvous.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe romantic function of the flash has long been known. What’s more recently been uncovered is a clear understanding of exactly how it happens. Scientists have tracked the trait down to a set of five molecules located in light-producing cells called photocytes that line a firefly’s lantern: luciferin, luciferase, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nitric oxide (NO), and oxygen.\n\nInsects do not have lungs like humans do, but instead transport oxygen into their bodies through tubes called tracheoles. Oxygen travels through the tracheoles and enters the photocytes, where it binds to mitochondria. Normally the mitochondria would use the oxygen to release energy for regular cellular processes. But when it’s time to glow, fireflies send nitric oxide to bind to the mitochondria instead, freeing up the oxygen to fuel the light show about to begin. The oxygen enters another cellular structure, the peroxisome, and that’s where the fun begins.\n\nThe Potential \n\nBecause fireflies produce light without excess heat, mimicking their methods may help pave the way to developing more energy-efficient artificial light sources.

So, it’s not surprising that decorating eggs is one of the oldest forms of human art, dating back at least 60,000 years.\n\nIn the rest of nature, egg colors and patterns of some birds have been adapting for far longer, on the scale of tens of millions of years—not for the sake of art, but for survival. These bird species are in a kind of tug-of-war between “brood parasites” that sneak their eggs into other species’ nests and “hosts” that may be fooled into raising the foreign chicks.\n\nOnly about one percent of bird species are brood parasites. However, this trait has evolved at least seven times in birds, demonstrating it has clear advantages. Brood parasitism offloads parental duties, conserving the energy needed to build nests, hatch eggs, and raise fledglings—energy their hosts must expend instead. Some brood parasites, like the brown cowbird, are generalists. Rather than engaging in “trickery” to disguise their eggs, generalists deposit them in the nests of many different species, attempting to maximize the chance they’ll encounter a host species that can’t detect foreign eggs.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nOn the other hand, some brood parasites coevolve with a specific host species. Dr. Mary Caswell Stoddard, assistant professor of sensory ecology, evolution, and behavior at Princeton University, describes this coevolutionary competition as an “arms race,” where color is often the weapon of choice.\n\nSome evolve plumage or other traits that cause hatched fledglings to resemble their hosts. Others mimic host egg colors, wielding the same two pigments that all birds use to dye their eggshells—biliverdin, which is blue-green, and protoporphyn IX, which is rusty brown. But the hosts can fight back with evolutionary countermeasures.\n\nStoddard says that these tint tactics evolve slowly. “Often we’re talking hundreds or thousands of years. These are long-timescale processes,” she said. But recent research indicates some species may be able to adapt more rapidly, changing colors within about 50 years.\n\nThe Potential \n\nIn addition to the benefits of improving our understanding of evolution, Stoddard said this research lights her fire because, despite the great diversity of color signals that exist in nature, these are unique. “These eggs are such extraordinary mimics in some cases, it is a reminder of just how impressive evolution can be at generating novel and beautiful colors and patterns,” she said. “And in this case, it’s for deception.”"}, {"Source": "bottlenose dolphin", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "learn from peers", "Function2": "pass on knowledge", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/dolphins-learn-new-behaviors-from-their-peers/", "Strategy": "Peer‑to‑Peer Learning\nSpreads Innovations Rapidly\n\nNew generations of bottlenose dolphins adapt to changing situations by learning from peers and not just mothers.\nIntroduction \n\nThink of the last time you learned something from a friend.

This may not seem all that surprising, but up until recently, the only type of learning scientists had observed in dolphins was parent-child learning—the “do as mother does” strategy. Now, it seems some young dolphins have found a new way of capturing food, and it’s spreading like any online trend—from friend to friend, without (too many) moms involved.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe hip new foraging technique is called “shelling.” A dolphin chases a fish into a large shell (such as that of a sea snail), carries the shell up to the surface of the water using its snout, or rostrum, then dumps the water out of the shell in such a way that the fish falls right into the dolphin’s open mouth. This is only the second reported case of tool usage in dolphins. The other technique, called “sponging,” is where a dolphin carries a sea sponge on the tip of its rostrum and uses it to sift through rocks and broken coral on the seafloor. The poking and prodding stirs up fish that normally hide amongst the sediments and debris, and the sponge, worn like a protective glove, prevents the dolphins’ rostra from being scraped up in the process. Interestingly, knowledge of the sponging technique tends to be passed on consistently from mother to child. Statistical analysis of shelling, on the other hand, indicated that an estimated 57% of dolphins learned the technique through “social transmission,” from peers or older non-parent individuals.\n\nThe Potential \n\nAs our planet experiences more and more rapid environmental change, humans may need to take one from the dolphins, encouraging innovation and knowledge sharing both between and within generations. Wisdom passed from parent to child is crucial for an individual’s survival, but when new ideas can also be introduced and spread from peer to peer, a population’s resilience will increase exponentially."}, {"Source": "bees and wasps' nest", "Application": "light-weight building materials", "Function1": "build space-efficient and strong nests", "Function2": "store more honey in a larger volume", "Function3": "high compression strength", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/honeycomb-structure-is-space-efficient-and-strong/", "Strategy": "Honeycomb Structure Is\nSpace‑Efficient and Strong\n\nBees and wasps build space-efficient and strong nests using hexagonal cells.\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe question of why honey bees adapted to building their nests from hexagonal cells has been debated for centuries. In On the Origin of Species, Darwin theorized that natural selection led to “an economy of wax.” Being frugal with wax is wise work for a honey bee given they need to consume approximately eight pounds of honey to produce one pound of wax.\n\nBut it took mathematicians studying the hexagon shape to make a beeline to the truth. Around 36 B.C., a scholar by the name of Marcus Terentius Varro first wrote about this particular math problem, later dubbed the “the honeycomb conjecture,” by stating that, compared to other shapes such as a triangle or a square, a “hexagon inscribed in a circular figure encloses the greatest amount of space.”\n\nThe Strategy \n\nIn a 2019 interview, Thomas Hales—the mathematician who finally proved the conjecture—said that ultimately, “A hexagonal honeycomb is the way to fit the most area with the least perimeter.” From a bee’s perspective, that means storing more honey in a larger volume while spending less energy building a structure to contain it. In other words, Darwin was right.\n\nAnd space-efficiency isn’t the only benefit of building with hexagons. Stacked together, hexagons fill spans in an offset arrangement with six short walls around each “tube,” giving structures a high compression strength. Beehives also dissipate heat well, preventing the waxy structure from melting on hot days. Though few species of wasps store honey, they too build nests using hexagonal cells, taking advantage of these same benefits. Efficiency, strength, and controlled heat loss are all important for human structures as well, so it’s no wonder that honeycombs inspire human design.\n\nThe Potential \n\nScientists and engineers have incorporated hexagonal designs into seemingly endless applications, including light-weight building materials, flexible panels for bridge construction, sound absorption, light diffusion, catalyst design, magnetic shielding, tissue engineering, and even building better surfboards.\n\n“He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration,” wrote Darwin. As we examine these structures more than a century and a half later, we’re still finding new things to admire and emulate."}, {"Source": "earwig wing", "Application": "self-deploying crafts", "Function1": "self-fold wing", "Function2": "quickly self-fold", "Function3": "snap from a stable folded state to a stable open state", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/earwigs-complex-origami-wing-fold/", "Strategy": "Earwigs’ Complex Origami Wing‑Fold\n\nA complex series of joints enables earwig wings to spring from folded to flight without the use of muscles.\nIntroduction \n\nFlying may be at the top of the list for desirable superpowers, but not many of us think of the incredible wings of humble earwigs (order Dermaptera), common insects small enough to fit on a penny. Often referred to as “pincher bugs” in the U.S. due to their large pincers, they can often be found crawling around dark, damp places like basements and wood piles. Their name comes from the historic misconception that they sought out the inside of human ears, but rest assured, they want nothing to do with your earwax. They do, however, have some of the most impressive wings in the animal kingdom.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nUsually neatly tucked away under leathery forewings, earwig wings spring into shape when needed for flight, expanding more than ten times larger than their folded size. They’re a prime example of a natural folding pattern optimized for both flying strength and flexibility.\n\nDespite their relatively large size, insect wings contain active muscles only where the wing attaches to the body. But this doesn’t detract from the wings’ ability to support the insect’s weight and maintain stability in the air.\n\nIn earwigs, the key is in the structure of the wing, which has evolved to quickly self-fold from the open to the closed state. Instead of using muscles, it is preprogrammed within the folding structure, using joints similar to, but more complex than, those found in the ancient Japanese craft of origami.\n\nShaped a bit like a folding fan, the wing is divided into a stiff outer and a more flexible inner region, with the leading edge supplying some stiffness from the base to the wing tip. This strong leading edge helps it bear aerodynamic loads. A critical central mechanism gives the wing the ability to snap from a stable folded state to a stable open state: when folded it takes the shape of convex and concave folds, whereas in the open state it becomes a concave pyramid, locking into place for flight and giving the open wing stability. The entire wing is curved slightly in the middle, allowing it to withstand higher bending forces than if it were completely flat.\n\nThe strength of such a flexible wing is due to the presence and distribution of resilin, a type of protein found in the joints, or creases. Resilin strengthens the wing along these joints, which provide both folding lines and flexion lines (lines along which the wing bends up or down during flight). The joints come in two forms: asymmetrical joints give the wing rotational spring, while symmetrical joints allow for greater extension or stretching.\n\nFlexible wings come with a number of benefits over rigid wings: earwigs can fly slowly, move at a wide range of speeds, and have a high level of maneuverability in the air. All this on top of their incredibly lightweight nature and ability to be tucked away for protection.\n\nThe Potential \n\nEarwigs have the potential to revolutionize human design by demonstrating that delicate, lightweight materials can have incredible strength while still offering flexibility.\n\nEarwig wings have evolved a remarkable structure that simultaneously supports the folding process as well as flight, all controlled passively by stored energy within the structure itself. Using these mechanisms could inspire and improve human design on a range of materials, from everyday objects like self-collapsing maps and tents, to self-deploying crafts used for space exploration –it could really cause a whole new world to “open up.”"}, {"Source": "magnetotactic bacteria", "Application": "nanopumps", "Function1": "detect earth's magnetic field", "Function2": "simplify navigation", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/the-bacteria-that-ride-magnetic-field-lines/", "Strategy": "The Bacteria That Ride Magnetic Field Lines\n\nBiologically produced crystals help some bacteria detect Earth's magnetic field to simplify navigation.\nIntroduction \n\nAt winter’s end, somewhere in the Arctic, you look around to see the night sky dance with green bands of light that reflect on the snow below, painting the white landscape a deep jade.\n\nThe aurora, or northern or southern lights, occur when high-energy particles from solar flares smash into gas molecules in our atmosphere. And the light these collisions produce travels along invisible magnetic field lines that wrap Earth in a spaghetti network called the magnetosphere.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe magnet-directed movement of these aquatic bacteria is called “magnetotaxis.” It doesn’t pull bacteria along geomagnetic field lines like a magnet attracts metal, but only aligns their single-celled bodies with those lines. The bacteria must still wiggle their flagella to move forward or backward.\n\nThe Potential \n\nMagnetite nanoparticles, like those found in magnetotactic bacteria, could become critical components of many nanotechnological innovations.

To do so effectively, it has to process a lot of fluid, which also ends up removing water, minerals, and glucose from the blood—things our bodies need.

Thousands of muscles guide its delicate dance as it probes every which way. Full of muddy water—up to 3 gallons (12 liters)—it swings above the elephant’s head and curls upward so he can spray his own back with the cooling mixture.\n\nIn 1706, Scottish surgeon and anatomist Patrick Blair described the complex musculature of an elephant’s trunk, noting intricate patterns of muscle fibers that permit such varied movement. “And I think I may with good reason make an analogy betwixt it and the tongue,” he wrote, because both trunks and tongues lack bones, enabling these organs to contort in almost any direction.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nMost muscles require bones to support them and joints to cantilever their movements. To raise your forearm from your side, you flex your biceps, which rotates the forearm across the hinge of your elbow.\n\nMuscular organs without bones and joints—like elephant trunks, snake tongues, and octopus arms—are called muscular hydrostats. They support themselves instead with a complex arrangement of muscle fibers. The most important feature of hydrostats, and what enables them to move without bones, is that the volume of water within them stays constant. An elephant trunk is composed almost entirely of water and muscle (which is itself mostly water). Because this volume of water stays constant, when the elephant moves its trunk in one direction, there will automatically be a compensating change in another direction.\n\nThe Potential \n\nElephant trunks contain more than 40,000 muscles while entire human bodies contain fewer than 650. Trunks can lift 770 pounds (350 kg) yet pick up a single tortilla chip without breaking it.\n\nThe field of robotics has infinite applications for strong, dexterous movements. Robots that mimic elephant trunks have already been developed to grip fragile objects or serve as a “third-hand” for medical applications.

The production and development of these seeds requires significant amounts of energy from photosynthesis, but the constant shading from other trees makes access to light difficult.  Thus, the mountain pine must be able to maximize its photosynthetic capacity even under low light-conditions in order to ensure seed production.\n\nPlants normally absorb light in the visible spectrum, and either scatter or filter UV light because it can be damaging to multiple plant processes. However, the leaves of the dwarf mountain pine contain a waxy cuticle loaded with fluorophores, which absorb UV light and convert it into blue light, which can then be used for photosynthesis. This allows the mountain pine to increase the amount of light it can use for photosynthesis, providing it with energy even under low-light conditions."}, {"Source": "flower", "Application": "solar panels", "Function1": "alter cell water level", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/flowers-follow-sun/", "Strategy": "Water Pressure Helps Flowers Follow the Sun\n\nLight intensity concentrates hormones that alter the water levels in cells causing plants to bend toward the light source.\nIntroduction \n\nPlants may not seem to lead lives as complex as those of animals, especially since they can’t move much from the spot where they’ve sprouted. They have, however, found many ways around their immobile lifestyle to reproduce, compete with other plants for resources, adapt to their environment, and avoid or defend themselves from herbivores.\n\nWhile they cannot relocate, plants can alter their structure in response to changes in their environment: this turning of part or all of the organism is called tropism. The various types of tropisms include gravitropism (reacting to gravity), thigmotropism (reacting to physical contact), phototropism (reacting to light), and heliotropism (growing or changing their shape in response to sunlight specifically). An example of this is a flower opening, closing, and/or orienting itself at different times of the day according to when the sun is out and where it is.\n\nHeliotropism requires some use of energy, but it’s worth the effort for plants because it helps them to get much more of the energy they need to continue growing, maintain ideal temperatures, and attract pollinators.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nTropism of all kinds works because environmental cues trigger a hormonal response that causes the plant’s cells to grow or expand – some faster than others. The plant redirects itself over time as its tissues respond to these environmental cues.\n\nAuxins are a class of hormones known to be involved in a plant’s response to light. An increase in auxin levels occurs in the part of the plant that receives less light, which results in the elongation of cells in those areas through a weakening of the rigid cell wall and an increase in the cell’s water intake. This response reaches the tissue level when many cells have expanded on the shaded side of the plant. The plant may continue to orient itself in the direction it is growing, change its orientation to align with sunlight, or orient itself at an angle to sunlight if there are other aspects of its environment preventing it from aligning perfectly with the sun.\n\nThe Potential \n\nOur knowledge of heliotropism, along with other ways plants move and orient themselves, can serve as a foundation for the development of crop management strategies and biomechanical technologies.\n\nTaking inspiration from plant heliotropism can help us to develop more sustainable technologies for harnessing solar energy, through the ingenious strategy of following the sun without uprooting. It has already inspired the creation of self-directing solar panels that use soft robots made of materials that bend and move with changes in water pressure to face the sun and absorb and store as much light as possible.\n\nWhile a plant’s responses to myriad environmental cues are difficult to tease apart, what tropism comes down to is adapting relatively quickly to the environment according to the plant’s needs.

Mantis shrimp that are “smashers” use a hammer-like strike to destroy the shells of snails and other mollusks, exposing the soft body of the animal so that it can be eaten. The mantis shrimp’s strike can even smash aquarium glass. It does this with a tough bulbous heel on the raptorial appendages, which function in both feeding and protection. The raptorial appendage, like most of the mantis shrimp’s body, is composed of tough exoskeletal material. It is divided into four segments: the merus (closest to the body) houses the major muscle groups. Next is the carpus, propodus, and then the dactyl, which differs in shape depending on the species of mantis shrimp. “Smashers” bear the hard heel on their dactyls. While there are many different species of mantis shrimp, the raptorial appendages use the same principle to generate rapid and forceful movement. This principle is called power amplification.\n\nPower amplification systems amplify the mechanical power generated by relatively slow muscle contractions by separating muscle contraction and movement into two sequential steps: the load phase and the release phase.\n\nIn the load phase for the mantis shrimp raptorial appendage, flexor muscles in the merus contract to engage small hardened parts of the merus against other parts of the exoskeleton, which function like a latch to keep the whole appendage in place and prevent movement. At the same time, extensor muscles in the merus contract and bend other exoskeletal parts of the merus (the saddle and ventral bars), which store energy like a compressed spring. These flexor and extensor muscles are antagonistic, meaning that they produce opposite movements if they contract individually (your biceps, which flexes the arm, and triceps, which extends the arm, are a pair of antagonistic muscles); however, contracting at the same time enables the large extensor muscle to contract slowly while the appendage is flexed and “latched.” Instead of moving the appendage, the extensor muscle’s slow contraction stores energy as elastic potential energy, essentially loading a spring while it prepares to strike.\n\nWhen the mantis shrimp is ready to strike, the release phase begins as the flexor muscles relax to release the latch. The appendage’s saddle and ventral bars spring back to their original shape, releasing their stored elastic energy and causing the dactyl segment to rotate forward at speeds up to 45 miles/hour! Because the appendage motion in the release phase takes place over only milliseconds, the mantis shrimp greatly increases the power of its strike.\n\nThere’s more to this story, though: check out this related strategy describing how the mantis shrimp’s extremely fast appendages produce a cavitation bubble that creates even more force."}, {"Source": "vein system", "Application": "network design", "Function1": "optimize water and nutrient flow", "Function2": "rapidly respond to fluctuations in flow", "Function3": "resilient to damage", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/looped-network-optimizes-water-and-nutrient-flow/", "Strategy": "Looped Network Optimizes\nWater and Nutrient Flow\n\nVein systems in leaves allow for optimal flow and resilience to damage due to a dense network of nested, interconnected loops.\n\nIn both natural and man-made systems, networks transport materials from a central source to widely distributed destinations. Branched, tree-like networks that contain repeatedly forking nodes, as are often found in river networks and sewage systems, are one of the most common network designs. Although this design allows for rapid and efficient transport through a system, it is only optimal if the flow is constant across time and space. In other systems, such as the blood vessels of the brain and the veins of leaves, networks must be optimized to quickly respond to fluctuations in load, or rapidly re-route flow in response to damage. These networks all have a common pattern of interconnected, nested loops. Loops are essential for these networks, because they allow material to follow different paths as conditions change.\nFor example, in leaves of the lemon tree, a main vein runs through the center, transporting water to the photosynthetic cells, and sugars away from them. Secondary veins branch off the main vein, similar to a tree-like network. However, all the veins are additionally connected to each other through a pattern of nested loops, with several smaller loops inside larger ones. This pattern of interconnected, nested loops throughout the leaf allows for flow to be quickly re-routed to any other vein in the event of injury, or when a change in flow is required.

Oxygen was long believed to be the only oxidizing agent that would allow an organism to efficiently metabolize nutrients. Certain bacteria, like Shewenella, that live in oxygen-free environments have instead evolved the ability to use minerals as oxidizers for metabolism instead of oxygen. In fact, they can do this while the insoluble mineral remains outside the cell.\n\nLike many processes in nature, oxidation leverages a balance between opposing forces, which in this case, is the taking and giving up of electrons — the substance being oxidized gives up one or more electrons that are, in turn, taken up by the oxidizing agent (a substance that has accepted electrons is said to be “reduced”). Chemically speaking, all participants are satisfied in the end. But in order for the exchange of electrons to occur, there has to be a pathway for them to flow between the oxidizing agent and the substance being oxidized, just like a cord acts as a pathway for the electrons-in-waiting in an electric socket to reach a light bulb in a lamp. Most organisms, including humans, bring the oxidizing agent (the oxygen we inhale) and the substance to be oxidized (the nutrients in the food we consume) together inside our cells to facilitate the oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction. Remarkably, rather than “inhaling” iron oxide, Shewenella passes the electrons along a series of proteins that extend from inside the cell, through the inner and outer cellular membranes and into the space outside the cell where the electrons are taken up by the insoluble metal mineral thereby completing the redox reaction.\n\n"}, {"Source": "clownfish and sea anemone", "Application": "waterproof coatings", "Function1": "provide shelter", "Function2": "provide fertilizer", "Function3": "mutual protection", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/intricate-relationship-allows-the-other-to-flourish/", "Strategy": "How the Clownfish and Sea\nAnemone Help Each Other\n\nOne provides shelter, the other provides fertilizer, and both are better off for it.\n\nIntroduction \n\nOf the more than 1,000 anemone species that live in the ocean, only 10 species coexist with the 26 species of tropical clownfish.

Other creatures don’t have that option, so they have evolved unique strategies for protecting themselves from the cold. One such strategy features a special protein.\n\nSea ice diatoms are single-celled algae that live in cold, aquatic environments, including in the brine channels or on the surface of polar sea ice. They have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves against the extremes of temperature, salinity, and light found in polar environments.\n\nIce crystals grow around the outermost layer, or cell wall, of sea ice diatoms. The diatom excretes something called an extracellular (meaning outside the cell) ice-binding protein (IBN). This protein binds to the ice crystals and prevents the diatom from freezing. Scientists think the protein fits the shape of the ice-crystals, like a three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle. The protein locks the tiny ice crystals in place and prevents them from becoming a larger ice crystal, in a process called ice recrystallization.\n\nIce recrystallization is one of the primary means of cell death in freezing temperatures. While small ice crystals can exist at the surface of cells without causing cell death, large ice crystals cannot. Large ice crystals form when small ice crystals next to each other join together and align themselves in the same direction. Then they act like knives to the cells. The large ice crystals are powerful enough to force their way in between cells and puncture the cell wall. The insides of the cells, when exposed to freezing temperatures, die. The extracellular ice-binding proteins prevent the large ice crystals from forming and are essential for the growth and survival of sea ice diatoms embedded in ice. (Nature often replicates a strategy that works, and IBPs are found in many other organisms, including bacteria, fungi, algae, plants, insects, and fish.)\n\nDiatoms are found throughout the world. Scientists estimate they are responsible for around 40% of all primary production on earth. Through the process of photosynthesis, they produce much of the oxygen on earth.

Geometric patterns of dark and light coloration on its skin make the snake nearly invisible against the forest floor. Moreover, the dark sections of the viper’s skin have a unique blackness called “ultra black,” which makes the snake even harder to spot. While ordinary black surfaces absorb most of the light that hits them, some light escapes and is reflected back to the viewer. This viper’s black scales, however, reflect almost no light, taking on a velvet-like appearance. Though the snake’s scales do contain pigments, the secret to this ultra-blacknesses lies in the micro- and nano-structure on each scale’s surface. By preventing reflection, these surface structures enhance the light absorption of the pigments, creating an even darker black.\n\nThe way in which this unique coloration is created is called “structural color.” Scientists have discovered this kind of color production across many animals and some plants, such as  the vibrant blue of the Morpho butterfly and the iridescent skin of berries. Most of the colors we see on a daily basis are likely caused by pigments rather than structures. Pigments are chemical molecules that absorb light of certain wavelengths. In the case of structural color, on the other hand, the shape of the surface material creates color by reflecting some but not all wavelengths of light. This leads to production of a certain coloration.\n\nWhat kind of structures can create a matte black surface like that of the Gaboon Viper? The viper’s black scales feature a hierarchical micro- and nanostructured surface. They are covered with 30 μm tall ridges, which are described by researchers as “leaf-like” structures. The surface of this microstructure has even tinier crests that are about 600 nm tall. Areas between the leaf-like projections are covered with hair-like protuberances (spinules). The size of these structures is similar to that of  visible wavelengths of light (380-700nm).\n\nThis microscopic structure creates ultra blackness in the viper by reducing light reflection. If light hits a smooth surface, it is usually reflected back to the viewer. The structures on the scale, however, are thought to guide light waves toward the viper’s skin instead of the viewer. Each time that light hits one of these micro/nano-structures, some is absorbed and the rest is reflected. The newly reflected light hits other micro/nano-structures, with some more light being absorbed and the remainder being reflected. This process repeats itself with less and less light being reflected each time until no more light can be reflected. By the end, very little light is reflected to the viewer. One study shows that velvet black scales reflect four times less light than pale scales do in the UV to near IR range. This reduced light reflection results in the unique velvet appearance of the viper’s black skin. Because of its microscopic surface structure, the viper’s skin is not glossy, allowing it to effectively hunt for prey and evade predators."}, {"Source": "shark's squalamine", "Application": "antiviral therapy", "Function1": "resist viral infection", "Function2": "prevent viral infection", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/steroid-prevents-viral-infection/", "Strategy": "The Shark Steroid That\nCloaks Cells From Viruses\n\nPositively-charged squalamine binds to negatively-charged cell membranes, displacing proteins and blocking viruses from replicating.\n\nIntroduction \n\nIn Native Hawaiian culture, people have at times performed rituals so that ancestors would become ‘aumakua—spiritual guardians often taking the form of animals, especially sharks.

They hold their wings angled to the ground and flap them back and forth in a figure-8 pattern.

The proteins also jump-start an inflammatory response, triggering symptoms like fever in an attempt to destroy the virus.\n\nUnfortunately, coronaviruses are good at evading this antiviral response. And the trouble doesn’t stop there. When human cells initiate their inflammatory response, things can quickly spin out of control into something called a cytokine storm. When that occurs, an uncontrolled cascade of \ninflammation can damage organs and if severe enough, cause death.\n\nThat’s not the case with certain bat cells, though. They maintain high levels of interferons, a type of cytokine that mounts an effective antiviral attack against coronaviruses without inducing runaway inflammation.\n\nThe Potential \n\nBanerjee’s research also showed that stress weakened the bats’ antiviral response, restoring the virus’s ability to replicate in their cells. And the greater the quantity of a virus in their bodies, the more likely bats are to “shed,” or excrete it into their surroundings. As a result, environmental threats like deforestation and development can cause food shortages and other stresses that make the chance of viruses crossing over from bats into humans more likely. Implementing conservation strategies to preserve bat habitats would not only decrease bat-human interactions but could also reduce stress-induced viral spillover, helping to protect humans from future pandemics.\n\nFurther study of bat immunity adaptations will expand our understanding of how bats transmit disease. It may also lead to therapies that dampen our inflammatory response to coronaviruses and other illnesses. So it seems the ancient Egyptians were on to something—bats may have healing powers after all."}, {"Source": "male sandgrouse's abdominal feathers", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "absorb water", "Function2": "deliver water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ultra-absorbent-feather-structure-carries-water-2/", "Strategy": "Ultra‑absorbent Feather\nStructure Carries Water\n\nHelically-structured barbules within the abdominal feathers of male sandgrouse reversibly absorb water.\n\nSandgrouse are a group of 16 species of ground-dwelling birds native to water-scarce, high-temperature regions of Africa and Asia. As exclusive seed eaters, sandgrouse obtain very little water through their diets, and therefore must drink liquid water regularly. Thus, many of the birds’ physical and behavioral traits are structured around their requirement for water in a demanding habitat.\n\nSandgrouse chicks rely on the delivery of water from their parents for 6-8 weeks, until they develop the flight capabilities necessary to travel to watering holes themselves. Unlike most birds, which use regurgitation to feed and water their young, 15 of the 16 sandgrouse species have a unique strategy to deliver water to these thirsty chicks. During a trip to a water source, a male sandgrouse performs a rocking motion in the water to thoroughly wet his specialized belly feathers. Upon returning to his nest, he stands upright and allows his chicks to suck water from his wet feathers. Sandgrouse have been observed transporting water in this manner upwards of 24 km (15 miles) from watering hole to nest. To avoid water evaporation over such long distances, sandgrouse typically fly during the coolest and most humid parts of the day (i.e. early morning or night)."}, {"Source": "hornbeam tree's leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "balance between flexibility and rigidity", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/folding-improves-flexibility-and-rigidity/", "Strategy": "Folding Improves Flexibility and Rigidity\n\nLeaves of the hornbeam tree have a corrugated fold pattern that allows for a balance between flexibility and rigidity.\n\nAs the sites of photosynthesis, leaves serve a critical function of the plant. However, because of their location on the edges of branches, leaves are also particularly susceptible to damage from the wind. A leaf can mitigate wind damage by bending or folding, which minimizes surface area exposure. However, leaves must also be able to stay flat and rigid, to maximize sun absorption for photosynthesis. Thus, leaves must find a compromise between a flexible state that protects from wind damage, and a rigid state that allows the leaf to maximize surface area exposure.\n\nOne way to achieve this balance is to use a simple corrugation pattern of alternating crest and valley folds, as is found in the leaves of the hornbeam tree. These folds emanate from both sides of the center vein and repeat along the length of the leaf. The valley folds allow space for the leaf to bend in on itself when needed, so as to minimize surface area and exposure to wind damage. The crest folds allow the leaf to sustain a rigid shape when required for photosynthesis.

A breath of oxygen-rich inhaled air remains in the respiratory system for two complete inhalation and exhalation cycles before it is fully spent and exhaled out the body.\n\nWhen fresh air is first inhaled through a bird’s nares (nostrils), it travels through the trachea (a large tube extending from the throat), which splits into left and right primary bronchi (called “mesobronchi,” with each bronchus leading to a lung). The inhaled air travels down each primary bronchus and then divides: some air enters the lungs where gas exchange occurs, while the remaining air fills the posterior (rear) air sacs. Then, during the first exhalation, the fresh air in the posterior sacs enters the lungs and undergoes gas exchange. The spent air in the lungs is displaced by this incoming air and flows out the body through the trachea. During the second inhalation, fresh air again enters both the posterior sacs and the lungs.

If a heater bee is trying to warm an individual brood cell, it can press against the top of the cell with its thorax, or midsection, to transfer heat to the developing young inside. Similarly, bees can also crawl inside a neighboring cell to transfer heat. The current leading hypothesis says heating is accomplished using muscle contraction for periods of time up to 45 minutes. The muscles that contract are flight muscles, and decoupling the wings from these muscles separates wing movement from muscle activity that would normally initiate flight; that way, the muscles can contract without moving the wings.

This process of actively shedding a whole body part is called autotomy. When a predator grasps onto a gecko, releasing the tail can help the gecko wriggle free and escape while the attacker is holding onto a severed tail or distracted by it.\n\nIn the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko), structures in the tail appear to help the shedding process. First, the base of the tail has built-in lines of weakness going across it, similar to perforated lines or score lines that make pieces of paper easier to tear apart. These lines of weakness, or fracture planes, cross the tail’s skin, muscles, bones, and other tissues. Like many animals, the gecko’s muscles form segments spanning the length of the body and tail. Sheets of connective tissue separate neighboring segments. The fracture planes run through the connective tissue between muscle segments and continue through the bony vertebrae that make up the backbone in the tail.\n\nWhen not under threat, the gecko’s tail is likely held in place by adhesion between the two sides of a fracture plane. This adhesion may be enhanced by the shape and arrangement of the muscle segments. Each segment can be thought of as a sideways “W” that interlocks with neighboring W-shaped segments. Compared to simple flat surfaces, the W-shaped structures have more surface area for adhesion. Micro-sized structures on the tips of individual muscle fibers also appear to play a role in tail adhesion and release. Researchers hypothesize that the shape of muscle fiber tips at the fracture plane can change to reduce adhesion during autotomy, making the tail easier to release. Contracting muscles around the fracture plane are also likely to help break tissues and release the gecko’s tail. Adhesion in this system appears to be a balance between enabling easy tail release when it’s needed, but preventing accidental release when it’s not.\n\nAutotomy occurs in many other animals, including other lizards, as well as amphibians and sea stars.

It is thought that sun leaves are better adapted to capture and use direct solar radiation (when it isn’t too intense to cause heat and other stress-related damage). Their elongate shape is also correlated with higher levels of solar radiation reaching the inner canopy where the shade leaves are located.

Shade leaves can also be found on the exterior canopy on the side that faces away from the prevailing sun.\n\nIt appears that exterior sun leaf characteristics can change with environmental conditions (they show plasticity), and that their shape in particular can influence the internal canopy environment that shade leaves experience. Plasticity in sun leaves seems to help stabilize inner canopy conditions, buffering it from abiotic stresses. Genetic variation and tree size also affect leaf characteristics, but it seems that whole-tree photosynthesis can be optimized by having sun and shade leaves respond differently to the environment.

Tension is generated within the flower as the inner stamen (a reproductive organ containing pollen) and outer petals of the flower grow at different rates. This differential growth causes the flowers to bulge out until the petals eventually split from each other. This creates small openings between the petals, allowing the flower to bulge out further, which further increases tension. When the flowers are mature, mechanical disturbance from pollinators will trigger opening of the petals.

It is hypothesized that this rapid folding deters herbivores and insects from eating the plant by making the plant appear smaller, while simultaneously exposing the sharp spines on the plant stems. The Mimosa also exhibits this movement during the night and when it is exposed to abiotic factors such as excessive heat and rain, protecting the plant from physical damage or desiccation.\n\nEach leaf of the Mimosa is a collection of small leaflets growing off of a midrib, usually with around 15 to 20 pairs of leaflets along each midrib. The angle between the midrib and the vein of each leaflet ranges from 25° to 85°. When the leaflets fold in response to touch, this angle decreases to between 15° to 25°.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe leaves of the Mimosa achieve this rapid folding by a change in turgor pressure. Turgor pressure is the amount of water pressure in the cell that is pushing up against the cell wall. When there is a lot of water pushing against the cell wall the turgor pressure is high, and cell is rigid. When water moves out of the cell, the turgor pressure decreases and the cell becomes flaccid. The movement of water into and out of the cell is known as osmosis. Osmosis occurs when there is an unequal concentration of solutes, such as sodium or potassium ions, on two sides of a membrane, in this case the cell wall. Water will flow from the solution with the higher concentration of solutes to the lower concentration, until an equilibrium between the two sides is reached.\n\nWhen the leaves of the Mimosa are touched, there is a change in the concentration gradient of potassium and chloride ions within two types of cells, the flexor and extensor cells, within the pulvinus of the plant. The pulvinus is the “hinge-like” area of the plant where the leaflet connects to the midrib, and the midrib connects to the stem. Water is channeled from the extensor cells, located on the top side, to the flexor cells, located on the bottom side of the pulvinus. This change is concentration of potassium and chloride ions causes water to flow out of the extensor cells, and they become flaccid, while water flows into the flexor cells, making them turgid. This causes the leaflets to fold and the midrib to droop from the stem.\n\nThe folding process takes between 4-5 seconds. After folding is complete, the unfolding of the leaflets can take anywhere from tens of seconds to up to 10 minutes. It is believed that the unfolding time is a result of behavioral adjustments that the plant makes over time in response to different kinds of stimuli. Herbivores prefer younger, tenderer leaves of plants. When younger leaves of the sensitive plant were repeatedly exposed to non-damaging stimuli, the younger leaves consistently folded completely, but over time, they decreased the time it took for them to unfold. \nConversely, older leaves folded only partially while maintaining similar reopening times. This shows that the plant is able to modulate its behaviour to optimize protection, energy production (photosynthesis), and energy expenditure (folding and unfolding).\n\nThe Potential \n\nObserving how plants respond to tactile stimuli could result in new methods for robotic movement with the goal of improving manufacturing and industrial processes.

This suggests that the sloth’s extra neck vertebrae are modified rib cage vertebrae.\n\nIt is not known exactly why these extra vertebrae evolved, but this extra range of motion makes it easier for a sloth to spot potential predators and mates, and may provide extra support for its head when hanging upside-down from trees."}, {"Source": "kukumakranka plant's leaves", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "adapt to dry, hot conditions", "Function2": "keep stomata open", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-adapt-to-dry-hot-conditions/", "Strategy": "Leaves Adapt to Dry, Hot Conditions\n\nLeaves of the Kukumakranka plant adapt to dry, hot conditions and continue photosynthesis by keeping their stomata open.\n\nPlants “breathe” or respire through their leaves by tiny adjustable openings in the leaves called stomata.

It resembles a vine-like plant with a long, thin stipe (stem-like structure) up to 30 meters long, anchored into the sea floor by a holdfast (root-like structure). At the stipe’s other end is a gas-filled float that holds 30-60 photosynthetic blades, each reaching up to 4 meters in length, near the water’s surface. Many marine macroalgae must withstand significant hydrodynamic forces imposed by tidal currents, waves and surface chop. If the mechanical force exerted by fluid flow exceeds the breaking strength of a kelp stipe or holdfast, the macroalga can break away and potentially die. Thus adaptations managing drag exerted on the kelp can be advantageous.\n\nOne example is the blade shape of bull kelp, which varies between habitats with differing degrees of flow. Bull kelp exposed to rapidly moving water grow flat, narrow blades compared to those found in calmer, protected sites that grow undulate (ruffled), wide blades. In faster flowing waters, narrow, flat blades flutter at smaller amplitudes allowing them to clump into more streamlined bundles. Experiments demonstrate that both the narrowness and flatness of a blade contributes to how well the blades can clump together, and that blade shape changes in response to mechanical stress (the changes are plastic). Both the cabbage-like kelp Saccharina sessile and the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera exhibit similar differences in blade shape between fast and slow flow environments, suggesting this difference in blade shape is a common way to manage drag.\n\nIf narrowness and flatness reduce drag, why would any kelp have wide, ruffled blades? Streamlining of bundles comes at the cost of self-shading, which leads to a reduction in photosynthetic rate. By moving at greater and more varied amplitudes, wide and ruffled blades prevent self-shading by spreading themselves apart and increasing their exposure to sunlight. Bull kelp experience a trade off between minimizing drag by streamlining and maximizing photosynthesis by spreading out. Since drag increases with flow speed, kelp in habitats exposed to powerful waves and tides invest in minimizing drag at the cost of photosynthesis while kelp in more protected habitats need not invest so heavily in drag reduction and can increase solar exposure."}, {"Source": "venus flytrap's stretched leaves", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "rapid trap closure", "Function2": "store potential mechanical energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/stretched-leaves-power-rapid-closure/", "Strategy": "Stretched Leaves Power Rapid Closure\n\nStretched leaves of the Venus flytrap power rapid trap closure by storing mechanical energy.\n\nThe Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) has to rapidly capture prey by ensnaring it between its leaves.

Aerial leaves are thicker, have a cuticle, and have stomata. Changes in leaf shape, size, and thickness and petiole or leaf/shoot length are common in facultatively heterophyllous species.

No matter the background, in a matter of seconds, poof, they’re gone.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nCuttlefish are able to match colors and surface textures of their surrounding environments by adjusting the pigment and iridescence of their skin, which is composed of several layers.\n\nOn the skin surface, chromatophores (tiny sacs filled with red, yellow, or brown pigment) ab­sorb light of various wavelengths. Once vis­ual input is processed, the cephalopod sends a signal to a nerve fiber, which is connected to a muscle. That muscle relaxes and contracts to change the size and shape of the chromato­phore. Each color chromatophore is controlled by a different nerve, and when the attached muscle contracts, it flattens and stretches the pigment sack outward, expanding the color on the skin. When that muscle relaxes, the chro­matophore closes back up, and the color dis­appears. As many as two hundred of these may fill a patch of skin the size of a pencil eraser, like a shimmering pixel display.\n\nThe innermost layer of skin, composed of leuc­ophores, reflects ambient light. These broadband light reflectors give the cephalopods a ‘base coat’ that helps them match the brightness of their surroundings.\n\nBetween the colorful chromatophores and the light-scattering leucophores is a reflective lay­er of skin made up of iridophores. Iridophores use structure to reflect incoming light, to take advantage of other colors provided by the environment. Iridophores selectively reflect light to create pink, yellow, green, blue, or silver coloration.\n\nThe combination of these skin layers allows cephalopods like the cuttlefish to blend in quickly with virtually any background.\n\nThe Potential \n\nTechnologies which control how much an object stands out or blends in have many different potential applications. “Smart” crosswalks, for example, could help to make crossing pedestrians more obvious to drivers and self-driving vehicles, and a truly smart phone being sought by its owner could change its color to contrast with the couch cushions it’s tucked between. The chromatophores of cuttlefish also give us the idea of materials that change colors with force or bending.

An animal can produce its colour directly using pigments, or it can use tiny microstructures or nanostructures to scatter light into different wavelengths and produce structural colour. Pigment colour will always look the same, but structural colour often manifests as an iridescent colour that changes hue as you look at it from different angles. Adding compounds that disrupt the structures, like water or alcohol, will cause the animal’s colour to lose its sheen, but the effect is reversed when the compound is removed. This concept is well explained in a video from National Geographic.\n\nMany bees from the Osmia genus have a brilliant iridescent blue shine.

Thick shells like those of crustaceans are especially difficult to penetrate without the aid of sharp and strong body parts and powerful muscles to back them up. Some organisms solve this challenge with only microscopic cellular components. Hydras, tiny animals from the cnidarian genus Hydra, feed on planktonic crustaceans and have evolved remarkable nano-structures that can penetrate the armor of their prey to inject venom.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe cells (cnidocysts) produce one large organelle called a nematocyst.

This spiral tendency is common in the growth of plants, often seen in the way flowers, leaves, and branches are spaced around a central stem or trunk. But besides being entrancing to the eye, there is a functional value in these patterns, and there is a simple basis behind the dazzling complexity.\n \n\nThe Strategy \n\nIn the case of leaves, if you look down on such a plant from above, you can see that the spiral placement maximizes each leaf’s exposure to the sun, minimizing any overshadowing of one leaf by another. Plants similarly want to maximize the number of seeds they can pack into a given area to maximize their chances of reproductive success. How these patterns form is what makes the story really interesting.\n\nInside a plant, the cells around a central axis contain various concentrations of biochemicals, such as the plant hormone auxin. Differences in these concentrations can influence where, around the circumference of that central axis, a flower, bract, or leaf bud will form. Mechanical forces, like pressure from other growing parts, can also shape the location of bud formation.\n\nIn plants using this spiral pattern, each new growth tends to form in a location around that circle that is as far away from previous growths as possible. So the first growth happens on one side of the circle, the second on the opposite site at 180° to the first. The third round of growth can’t be at 180° from that one, because that would place it directly above the first. So it’s at a slightly lesser angle to the second growth. That pattern of influence keeps shrinking the angle, but less so with each round of growth, getting closer and closer to about 137.5°. Following this pattern, leaves don’t overlap and overshadow one another, and seeds, flowers, and other parts efficiently fill the available space.\n\nThe Potential \n\nPlants have come up with a self-organizing developmental method that results in their optimal design. Human designs that require efficient spatial organization can borrow from this effective plant strategy for covering area, absorbing resources, and other applications. For example, engineers inspired by the arrangement of florets in a sunflower head reorganized the mirrors in a solar concentrator array. They discovered that, by doing so, they could concentrate the same amount of sunlight as before, yet use 20% less land area."}, {"Source": "sea cucumber's body", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "change mechanical properties", "Function2": "change elasticity and viscosity", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/body-changes-stiffness/", "Strategy": "Body Changes Stiffness\n\nThe body of the sea cucumber changes from soft to standard to hard due to stiffening and plastizing factors and exuding water.\n“Catch connective tissues or mutable collagenous tissues of echinoderms can extensively change their mechanical properties such as elasticity and viscosity within a few minutes under the regulation of their nervous system. The tissues contain a large amount of the extracellular matrix, mainly consisting of collagen fibrils, proteoglycans and microfibrils. The unique properties of these collagenous tissues might be due to lack of permanent associations between the collagen fibrils and the surrounding extracellular matrix because it is easy to isolate collagen fibrils from catch connective tissues – unlike collagenous tissues of adult vertebrates. It seems that crosslinking of the collagen fibrils with adjacent ones and other components of the extracellular matrix is formed or broken during changes in the mechanical properties of catch connective tissues. The molecular mechanisms underlying the change are, however, not yet fully understood. The holothurian body wall dermis is a typical catch connective tissue that shows rapid and reversible changes in its mechanical properties in response to various stimuli.

These are stiff, standard and soft states, which can be distinguished by elastic and viscous properties and by strain-dependent behaviors…The mechanical parameters of the standard state are not simply the intermediate values between the stiff and the soft states, suggesting that the molecular mechanism converting the soft to the standard state is different from that converting the standard to the stiff state.”"}, {"Source": "saharan silver ant's hair", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "reflect light and heat energy", "Function2": "dissipate excess heat", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hair-helps-cool-the-body/", "Strategy": "The hair of the Saharan silver ant keeps it cool by efficiently reflecting light and heat energy while also dissipating excess heat.\nSaharan silver ants (Cataglyphis bombycina) have a remarkable ability to thrive in one of the hottest regions on the planet—the Sahara Desert. Unlike the sleek skin, shells and scales of most high-temperature dwellers, these ants have a unique exterior defense mechanism to beat the heat: hair.\n\nThe hair of Saharan silver ants reduces heat absorption by efficiently reflecting sunlight and dissipating heat. This enables the ant to stay cool in the midday Sahara, where temperatures can reach up to 47°C (117°F). The hairs, with their unique shape, achieve this through three distinct mechanisms:\n\nFirst, the hairs reduce heat absorption by maximizing the amount of light that is reflected off their surface, a process known as total internal reflection (TIR). This is achieved through the unique prism shape of the hairs, which have a flat base that lies against the body of the ant, while the other two sides are grooved (see gallery images). When light enters through one of the grooved sides, it reflects off of the base, and then exits from the other grooved side. A groove concentrates a ray of light onto a certain part of the hair in order to optimize its path of exit and thus maximize TIR. Multiple grooves enable multiple rays of light to be reflected within the same hair simultaneously. The hairs are densely packed to ensure that a minimal amount of sunlight reaches the ant’s body underneath, keeping it 2°C cooler than it would be without the hairs.\nSecond, the hairs also reduce heat absorption by reflecting sunlight (solar radiation) from both visible and non-visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the near-infrared (NIR). It is in these two regions that solar radiation is at its most powerful.\n\nAnd third, the silver ant has a particularly effective method of offloading excess heat. The shape of the hairs increases the ant’s ability to radiate heat—known as emissivity—in a specific range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the mid-infrared (MIR). Within this range, the ant’s warm body can most effectively give off excess heat energy to cooler surrounding air via thermal radiation. Ant researcher Nanfang Yu explains: “To appreciate the effect of thermal radiation, think of the chilly feeling when you get out of bed in the morning. Half of the energy loss at that moment is due to thermal radiation, since your skin temperature is temporarily much higher than that of the surrounding environment.” This mechanism enables the ant to maximize the amount of heat it emits and cool itself off. The last two mechanisms cool the ant off by an additional 5-10°C, enabling the silver ant to withstand temperatures up to 53.6°C (128.48°F)."}, {"Source": "clark's nutcracker's throat pouch", "Application": "design a juice bottle", "Function1": "store seed", "Function2": "expand and collapse", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pouch-stores-seed/", "Strategy": "Pouch Stores Seed\n\nThe throat of the Clark's nutcracker can temporarily store up to 150 small seeds thanks to an expandable pouch.\nExpand and collapse: Many of life’s containers are flexible, like the throat pouch of the Clark’s nutcracker that expands to hold 150 pine-nut-sized seeds, or the pelican pouch that scoops 3 gallons of seawater, then returns to shape.

Subsequent heat transfer analysis shows that habitat wind speed and shading conditions also affect face temperature gradients such as the rate of eastern face temperature change.

In creep tests on samples, strain increased from an initial value of about 0.2 to a final level ten times that, achieved after around 10 hours. That means the mesoglea has a lot of viscosity relative to its elasticity–it’s hard to make it do anything fast but fairly easy to make it change shape slowly. It has a retardation time (calculated by Biggs; see Vincent [1990]) of a little under an hour. How nice! The pulsating or reversing flows of waves passing above won’t sweep it about very much, but after it has hunkered down, the low-pressure ciliary pump will be adequate to pump it back up again, albeit slowly. It can stand up to a single wave but deflect in a tidal current that imposes the same drag. Furthermore, the anemone’s body wall can resist the stresses of its own short-term muscle contractions, so it can bend or straighten without getting an aneurysm whenever its muscles aren’t active.”\n"}, {"Source": "tapetum lucidum", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "enhance night vision", "Function2": "increase retinal sensitivity", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/eye-structure-enhances-night-vision/", "Strategy": "Eye Structure Enhances Night Vision\n\nThe tapetum lucidum of many vertebrates enhances night vision by reflecting light back to photoreceptors in the eye.\n\n“The tapetum lucidum is a biologic reflector system that is a common\nfeature in the eyes of vertebrates.

Respiration, digestion, cognition, circulation, and other continuous processes depend on the steady movement and exchange of molecules across membranes; water is the medium that allows this movement to happen. Left to its own devices, water seeks to find a balance between both sides of a membrane to achieve equal concentrations of dissolved minerals and organic compounds. But the inner workings of living things often rely on differences across membranes to fuel various functions.\n\nOne way of achieving this is to leverage water’s innate balance-seeking driving force. This dance relies on compounds attached to or imbedded in cell membranes that pull or push water or dissolved constituents across the membrane so that the concentration is greater on one side than the other. At the opportune moment, the cell then uses water’s balance-seeking force to do work.\n\nIn other situations, living things need to counter water’s innate balancing act in order to keep a steady concentration of dissolved constituents inside the cell, regardless of outside conditions. Such is the challenge for spotted green pufferfish that encounter varying degrees of salinity in their environment. To maintain a steady level of chloride ions inside their cells, pufferfish have two membrane bound proteins (CFTR and NKCC) in specialized epithelial cells of their gills that form ion channels across the membrane.

Rats, like other rodents–squirrels, mice, beavers, porcupines–cope with that problem by maintaining open roots to their front gnawing teeth, the incisors, so that they continue to grow throughout the animal’s life compensating for wear. They are kept sharp by a simple but very effective self-stropping process. The main body of the rodent incisor is made of dentine, but its front surface is covered by a thick and often brightly coloured layer of enamel which is even harder.

A peculiarity of the dragonfly is its use of a rowing motion along an inclined stroke plane. During hovering, the body lies almost horizontal. The wings push backward and downward, and at the end of the stroke, feather and slice upward and forward. In contrast, many other hovering insects use a symmetrical back-and-forth stroke near a horizontal stroke plane. The dragonfly’s asymmetric rowing motion allows it to support much of its weight by the upward drag created during the downstroke; for the more common symmetric motion, the drag roughly cancels.\n\n“The dragonfly belongs to Odonata, one of the most ancient of insect orders. Its fore and hind wings are controlled by separate muscles, and a distinctive feature of the dragonfly’s wing movement is the phase relation between those wings during various maneuvers. When hovering, the fore and hind wings tend to beat out of phase; during takeoff, they tend to beat closer in phase. Why does a dragonfly vary the phase in different maneuvers? One plausible explanation is that alternating the downstroke reduces body oscillation. That is, however, only part of the story. The fore and hind wings are about a wing-width apart—close enough for them to interact hydrodynamically. To determine the amount of interaction, one solves the Navier–Stokes flow equations with boundary conditions set by the movement of the wings. The resulting flows are spectacular and complex. They depend on Reynolds\nnumber, wing motion, wing shape, and phase difference.\n\n“Despite that complexity, two general results emerge: The aerodynamic power expended is reduced when the wings move out of phase, and the force is enhanced when the wings move in phase. When the fore and hind wings beat out of phase, they approach each other from opposite sides and cross near the midstroke. The fore wings experience an induced flow due to the hind wings, and vice versa. As a consequence, the drag on the wings is reduced, as is the power expended in flapping. But the reduction in drag on the two types of wing points in opposite directions, so the net force is essentially unaffected. In other words, the counterstroking allows the dragonfly to generate nearly the same force while saving aerodynamic power. If, instead, the fore and hind wings beat in phase, they will experience a higher drag due to the induced flow. In this case the increase in drag on all the wings points in the same direction. Thus the hydrodynamic interaction results in a greater net force that can be used to accelerate as needed during takeoff. The cost is greater power expenditure.” \n"}, {"Source": "anme‑1 and anme‑2 archaea", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "methane oxidation", "Function2": "consume methane", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/microbes-consume-methane/", "Strategy": "Microbes Consume Methane\n\nThe metabolism of ANME‑1 and ANME‑2 Archaea allows survival in anoxic environments via methane oxidation, and are often found in association with sulfate‑reducing bacteria.\n\n“Evidence supporting a key role for anaerobic methane oxidation in the global methane cycle is reviewed. Emphasis is on recent microbiological advances. The driving force for research on this process continues to be the fact that microbial communities intercept and consume methane from anoxic environments, methane that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. Anaerobic methane oxidation is biogeochemically important because methane is a potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere and is abundant in anoxic environments. Geochemical evidence for this process has been observed in numerous marine sediments along the continental margins, in methane seeps and vents, around methane hydrate deposits, and in anoxic waters. The anaerobic oxidation of methane is performed by at least two phylogenetically distinct groups of archaea, the ANME-1 and ANME-2. These archaea are frequently observed as consortia with sulfate-reducing bacteria, and the metabolism of these consortia presumably involves a syntrophic association based on interspecies electron transfer. The archaeal member of a consortium apparently oxidizes methane and shuttles reduced compounds to the sulfate-reducing bacteria. Despite recent advances in understanding anaerobic methane oxidation, uncertainties still remain regarding the nature and necessity of the syntrophic association, the biochemical pathway of methane oxidation, and the interaction of the process with the local chemical and physical environment.

They do this in two ways. The first is with anatomical specializations that enable the eyes to rotate with a high degree of freedom. The second is the chameleon’s ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision, meaning they can view objects with either eye independently, or with both eyes together.\n\nSeveral anatomical features enable chameleons to rotate their eyes to such a high degree. The eyes are located on opposite sides of the head, providing a view to the sides and behind or toward the front. Internally, the eye balls are mounted in twin conical turrets (like two upside down ice cream cones). Without a deep orbital socket to keep the eye from falling out (as in humans), the chameleon has evolved a thick, muscular lid. This lid surrounds each eye turret, leaving only the pupil exposed. This provides a “safety net” that enables the eye to bulge out of the conical turret. Without the restriction of a deep orbital socket, each eye can rotate nearly 180 degrees, giving a much wider range of vision than animals whose eyes are secured in socket structures.\n\nThe ability to transition between monocular and binocular vision also enables the chameleon to view objects panoramically. While searching for prey, the chameleon uses monocular vision, with each eye functioning independently of the other. The eye movements–or saccades–are referred to as ‘uncoupled’ when functioning this way. Two separate bundles of nerves control the musculature of the eyes, and two separate images are sent to the brain. Once the chameleon spots its prey, the saccades synchronize, in a process called “coupling,” and both eyes lock on the object. For coupling to occur, visual signals are first sent to the brain through two non-coupled neural bundles. The brain reads these signals, and the eye that has spotted the prey sends stronger electrical impulses to the brain than the eye still searching for the target. The neuron from the eye that does not see the prey syncs with the one that does, forming a larger neural bundle. Once the eye movements are synchronized, the eyes fix on the object and only the head rotates.\n\nThe chameleon’s ability to switch freely between synchronous and uncoupled saccadic eye movement is like having two movies playing in your head, and if you wanted to only watch one, you could. This enables the chameleon to operate as both a binocular and monocular organism in a remarkably efficient way for protection, food gathering, and reflexes.\n"}, {"Source": "dinoflagellates", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "avoid predation", "Function2": "alert higher order predators", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bioluminescence-protects-from-predation/", "Strategy": "Bioluminescence Protects From Predation\n\nBioluminescence produced by some dinoflagellates helps protect them from predation by silently alerting higher order predators to the location of their enemies.\n\n“When plankton called dinoflagellates grow too numerous near shore, the single-celled algae can stain the water a reddish-brown, causing so-called red tides that are often toxic to people and fish alike.

Some are produced by pigments, chemicals within the feathers that absorb or reflect different wavelengths of light differently. Others are produced by minute physical structures that bend or reflect select portions of the light spectrum. Variations in those physical structures can scatter light rays in slightly different ways, allowing the creation of bright, iridescent colors that can even change when viewed from different angles.\n\nIn the case of the common kingfisher, it’s both of the above. This eye-catching bird, which lives in Europe, Asia, and Africa, has three different colors: orange on the breast, cyan (greenish-blue) on its back, and blue on its tail. It uses both chemical and structural coloration to deck itself in attractive plumage. (No one knows exactly how the bird benefits, though it may have something to do with attracting mates or competing for resources.)\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe feathers of common kingfishers, like those of other birds, are made up of a main stem, called a rachis, from which individual barbs branch off. However, kingfishers add a twist by having two distinct types of barbs. Both types have a thin outer layer called a cortex. But inside, they differ, and these differences produce different colors by different methods.\n\nOne type of barb, found on the bird’s chest, is made up of hollow cells with tiny granules of pigment inside. The granules selectively absorb short-wavelength blue light, giving the feathers an orange hue. The barb cells are also irregularly spaced, which randomizes the direction of incoming light and scatters the long-wavelength red light.\n\nThe bird’s back and tail feature a second type of barb. This type is made up of cells that are spongy with a small bubble inside. The spongy tissue reflects short-wavelength blue light in many directions, producing bluish iridescence. The sponginess differs from the back to the tail reflecting different wavelengths of light and creating the appearance of cyan and blue, respectively. Beneath the spongy cells are other cells that use a pigment to absorb light that bounces in their direction, helping the blue colors to “pop” by removing other “competing” wavelengths from the picture.\n\nOn top of all of this, the cortex of the blue feathers varies minutely in thickness, and serves as a thin film that reflects light across the entire visible light spectrum. This adds additional shimmer to the overall look.\n\nThe spongy tissue reflects short wavelength blue light in many directions, producing bluish iridescence.\n\nThe Potential Color is one of the fundamental tools humans use to communicate, signal, and decorate.

In this letter, we discuss the fern’s elastic response and suggest that by mimicking its structure, one should be able to design materials exhibiting interesting elastic behavior.\n\n“For many years, plants have been a rich information source for designing and optimizing materials and biomimetic systems. For example, Burdock plants had a direct impact on the invention of a novel hooking system, while the lotus leaf has inspired the creation of very hydrophobic surfaces. The elastic response of plants when exposed to external stimuli water, light, etc. is also rather interesting,and emerging biomimetic materials may just take advantage of this. Plant leaves are often stiff while fully hydrated but loose turgor and become soft under dry conditions. If they dry completely up, only the cellular matrix remains, and the leaf appears to be hard and brittle. However, some plants have a conceptually simpler elastic response, where the plant leaf is stiff in the dry state and soft in the wet state. Here, we study the resurrection fern Polypodium polypodioides, which has an amazing ability to take up water while at the same time altering its elasticity from a soft hydrated state to a stiff dehydrated state in order to cope with drought. Moreover, as reported in Ref. 6, the fern can reproducibly switch between a curled-up dry state and a fully extended and soft wet state and is, therefore, a natural shape-memory material.” \n\n“The structure of the resurrection fern is hierarchical (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 6), where the smallest elastic units are the plant cells arranged into palisade and spongy layers. Water flows into the layered structures due to capillary pressure, allowing the cells to absorb water as well. An artificial structure aiming at reproducing the elastic reponse of the fern must display a hierarchical structure which mimics that of the plant.”\n"}, {"Source": "pangolin scale", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "provide strong and durable protection", "Function2": "absorb the force of an attack", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/scales-provide-flexible-strong-protection/", "Strategy": "Scales Provide Flexible, Strong Protection\n\nScales of pangolins provide flexibility yet strong protection by overlapping like roof shingles.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTucked safely into a ball, impervious to the teeth and claws of an inquisitive lion cub, a pangolin seems to make survival look simple.\n\nMembers of this family though, which live in tropical parts of Africa and Asia, are literally among the toughest prey animals around. Except for their bellies, pangolins are covered with thick, overlapping scales made out of keratin, the same material that makes up human hair and fingernails.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nWhen not threatened, a pangolin spends its time burrowing in the ground or climbing in the trees foraging for ants and other insects. But when a predator appears, it curls up into a tight ball. The curved body causes the sharp edges of the scales to stick out. And the scales’ virtually impenetrable nature prevents teeth and claws from getting to the juicy parts inside.\n\nThe modular nature of the pangolin’s armor providespowerful protection without sacrificing flexibility.\n\nPangolin scales have a number of traits that help them provide strong and durable protection for their owner.\n\nStarting at the micro-level, they are made up of three distinct layers of flat, elliptical keratin-rich cells. On the top and bottom layers of each scale, the cells lie parallel to the surface in sheets that overlap. In the middle layer, however, the cells are tilted. The combination of flat, tough, overlapping layers and an inner layer with more diverse orientation of cells creates a structure that is hard to puncture but also absorbs the force of an attack. It is virtually impossible to shred, and readily stops a crack in its tracks if one starts to form. Not only that, but a threadlike substance stitches the flattened cells together, making it hard to separate the individual cells and layers one from another.\n\nOn a macro-scale, the scales are modular and overlap enough that they allow the animal to curl up without stretching or exposing bare spots of skin between the plates of its armor. They continue to grow throughout the pangolin’s life (much like our hair and skin) so they can continue to protect the animal throughout its life despite any wear that takes place. They have a corrugated outer surface, so they slide smoothly against each other and against soil or other substances. And if a predator dents the coat of armor while trying to get through, the pangolin can repair the scales after the attack by simply wetting itself down and letting its scales absorb water to balloon back to their original shape.\n\nThe combination of flat, tough, overlapping layers and an inner layer with more diverse orientation of cells creates a structure that is hard to puncture but also absorbs the force of an attack.\n"}, {"Source": "flower", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect pollen grains", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/flower-structures-protect-pollen/", "Strategy": "Flower Structures Protect Pollen\n\nStructures of flowers protect their pollen from rain by various physical structures.\n\nYun-Yun Mao and Shuang-Quan Huang of Wuhan University in China studied the response to rain and water of 80 species of flowers.

Even though it’s being buffeted by winds, this sharp-eyed member of the falcon family is able to keep its head virtually motionless and its eyes fixed on the creature. After hovering for a moment to collect itself, it plummets to the earth and snatches the meal in its sharp talons.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nKestrels are small birds of prey that are found throughout much of the Americas.  They are among a few birds, including hummingbirds, that have a special talent: They are able to keep their eyes trained on objects even as their bodies move. This helps a kestrel to keep sight of prey it has already located, and also allows it to locate new targets, since it can see clearly whether an object it is observing is moving\n\nA kestrel achieves this feat through a combination of four reflexes, movements that can happen extremely rapidly because they don’t require involvement of the brain. Two of these relate to the vestibular system, which controls balance, and two of which relate to the interaction between nerves and muscles that regulates eye movement.\n\nThe first of the four reflexes is called the vestibule-ocular reflex. This uses information from the eye and from the vestibular system to control eye movement relative to movement of the head and neck. The second, the vestibule-collic reflex, mobilizes neck muscles when it senses head movement. The third, the optolinetic nystagmus reflex, responds to the apparent movement of an image of an object on the retina by moving the eye in a way that keeps the image in the same spot on the retina. The fourth, the optocollic reflex, keeps the head motionless while the rest of the body moves. Together these reflexes help the kestrel to keep its eyes on the prize—and ultimately survive to pass the trait along to the next generation.\n"}, {"Source": "philodendron's flower", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "produce heat", "Function2": "metabolize stored lipids", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/flower-creates-heat/", "Strategy": "Flower Creates Heat\n\nThe flower of the philodendron produces heat by metabolizing stored lipids.\n\n“Night-flowering philodendrons heat up to more than 38 degrees C in order to attract scarab beetles.”\n\n“The all-time champ in heat production is a familiar plant to gardeners here in South Florida.

The mallee fowl of eastern Australia lays its eggs in a large mound built by the male. The core is composed of rotting vegetation and the whole is covered with sand. The breeding season is a very long one, spread over five months, and during all this time, the male has to remain in constant attendance probing the mound with his bill to test the temperature. In spring the newly gathered vegetation at the centre is decaying rapidly and producing so much heat that the mound may get too warm for the eggs within it, in which case he industriously removes sand from the top to allow heat to escape. In summer, there is a different danger: the sun may strike the mound and over-heat it. Now he must pile more sand on top as a shield. In autumn, when the decaying core has lost much of its strength, he removes the top layers to allow the sun to warm the centre where the eggs are and then covers it in the evening to retain the heat.”\n\n“Scrub fowl attack the daily supervision and reconstruction of their mounds as if the laws of heat distribution were entirely in their grasp. It seems as if, after establishing the interior temperature, they need only choose the proper profile of the breeding plant to maintain that temperature. The mallee fowl considers the existing climatic conditions instinctively (and, it seems, very sensibly) while it proceeds with its regulating activity. In spring, temporary air shafts are used to siphon off superfluous fermentation heat. When fermentation abates in summer and irradiation from the sun increases, the birds prevent overheating by piling up more sand and adding considerably to the height of the mound; they rely on inertia in the warming up of a large mass. Should nevertheless the heat of the sun penetrate dangerously deep, they change their tactics. They dig the breeding mound early in the morning and spread the sand for cooling. When it has cooled off, it is again used to build the pile up…Finally, when both fermentation and irradiation from the sun abate in the fall, the bird operates with a very thin layer of sand only, which quickly warms up in the sun. At the same time, sand is being heated in the sun close to the breeding mound under constant stirring; it is then mixed warm into the pile.”\n"}, {"Source": "damselfly's body", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "create colors", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pigment-granules-create-colors/", "Strategy": "Pigment Granules Create Colors\n\nThe bodies of damselflies have brilliant metallic colors derived from structural arrangement of pigment granules.\n\n“The brilliant metallic colours of many Odonata, especially damselflies, derive from the structural arrangement of pigment granules.

(PNAS 107: 7635–7639, 2010) it’s all down to ‘simple geometry’ and a phenomenon called harmomegathy. Although Katifori and colleagues did not invent the term, they do demonstrate that geometrical and mechanical principles explain how the wall structure guides pollen grains toward distinct folding pathways.

Some species have evolved a shocking workaround: an organ that produces pulses of electricity that can be used for navigating, communicating, and capturing prey.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe electric catfish (Malapterurus electricus) has a particularly notable pair of electric organs, one on either side of its body. On each side of the fish, a single giant nerve fiber runs from the spinal cord to the edge of a thin layer of tissue overlaying the muscle beneath the skin., This layer  consists of millions of flat cells (“electroplaques”) overlapping each other. A single stalk emerges from each cell and connects with a nerve, providing what scientists think is a synchronizing function that enables numerous nerves and electroplaque cells to act in concert to discharge electricity at the same time. The individual discharges are in the range of 100–400 volts, the same  order of  magnitude as that which characterizes the electricity in our homes.\n\nThe fish uses the concentrated charge in five distinct ways, each with a characteristic pattern of rapid-fire pulses of electricity.. It gives off a long train of rapid discharges when it is attacking and capturing prey.  It produces fewer, more bunched-up pulses when encountering fish of other species that might require defense or attack behavior. It uses a short, rapid release of electricity when surprised or to startle prey. It uses short, single bursts of electricity to detect or attract prey. And a long train of discharges that starts fast but slows down helps it communicate with other members of its own species.\n\nPotential\n\nThe unique structure of the electric catfish’s electric organ, with its millions of stacked cells with stalks connecting to neurons, allows the fish to both create a large charge and vary it from one situation to another. This capability to synchronize and customize the use of electricity in this way could potentially prove valuable insights for meeting a range of human needs, including  enhancing the quality of video transmission, improving the efficiency of renewable energy sources, and even fine-tuning precision surgery.\n \n"}, {"Source": "rainbow trout's scales", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "produce silvery shine", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/crystals-create-iridescent-sheen/", "Strategy": "Crystals Create Iridescent Sheen\n\nThe scales of a rainbow trout have a silvery shine due to guanine crystals.\n\n“The scales of a rainbow trout, reflective yet translucent.

In restrained silk fibers, supercontraction\ngenerates substantial stresses of 40–50 MPa above a critical humidity of ~70%\nrelative humidity (RH). This stress may maintain tension in webs under\nthe weight of rain or dew and could be used in industry for robotics,\nsensor technology, and other applications. Our own findings indicate\nthat supercontraction can generate stress over a much broader range than\npreviously reported, from 10 to 140 MPa. Here we show that this\nvariation in supercontraction stress depends upon the rate at which the\nenvironment reaches the critical level of humidity causing\nsupercontraction. Slow humidity increase, over several minutes, leads to\nrelatively low supercontraction stress, while fast humidity increase,\nover a few seconds, typically results in higher supercontraction stress.\nSlowly supercontracted fibers take up less water and differ in\nthermostability from rapidly supercontracted fibers, as shown by\nthermogravimetric analysis. This suggests that spider silk achieves\ndifferent molecular configurations depending upon the speed at which\nsupercontraction occurs. Ultimately, rate-dependent supercontraction may\nprovide a mechanism to tailor the properties of silk or biomimetic\nfibers for various applications.”\n"}, {"Source": "velvet belly lantern shark's light emitting organ", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "emit ventral light", "Function2": "hide silhouette", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/light-used-for-camouflage-2/", "Strategy": "Light Used for Camouflage\n\nLight emitting organs on the underside of velvet belly lantern sharks help camouflage them via bioluminescent counterillumination.\n\n“Many midwater animals emit ventral light to hide their silhouette in the\nwater column.

That means the mesoglea has a lot of viscosity relative to its elasticity–it’s hard to make it do anything fast but fairly easy to make it change shape slowly. It has a retardation time (calculated by Biggs; see Vincent [1990]) of a little under an hour. How nice! The pulsating or reversing flows of waves passing above won’t sweep it about very much, but after it has hunkered down, the low-pressure ciliary pump will be adequate to pump it back up again, albeit slowly.

This leads to the rigidification of cellular macromolecules and membranes which is a major cause of cellular death at low temperatures. A broad category of solutes, called chaotrophs, create more disorderly (i.e., less sticky) interactions at all temperatures, and therefore prevent molecular rigidity at low temperatures. In contrast, at moderate to high temperatures, the disordered interactions that chaotrophs promote lead to improper mechanics that cause cellular stress. Known chaotrophs include magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, glycerol, fructose, and urea. Conversely, a broad category of solutes called kosmotrophs perform in the exact opposite role; they promote non-covalent interactions between molecules which leads to poorer performance at low temperatures and higher performance at high temperatures.\n\nThe highly solute tolerant (xerotrophic) fungus Eurotium herbariorum has been documented accumulating environmental chaotrophs like fructose in its cells at low temperatures as well as synthesizing new ones like glycerol.

In order to maximize opportunities for photosynthesis, plants have evolved complex biochemical sensory pathways that initiate shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). SAS results in growth away from shade and is of critical importance to maintaining a plant’s competitive edge. The thale cress has evolved dual, redundant sensory mechanisms for avoiding shade. The phyB (phytochrome B) SAS pathway depends on detecting a decrease in the ratio of red light to far-red light (R:FR). In plants growing in the canopy above a thale cress, chlorophyl absorbs red light and cell walls scatter far-red light. Thus, a decrease in the R:FR ratio (the plant is exposed to less red light) is a good signal for the thale that it is in the shade of the canopy and should begin SAS processes to “escape”. When thale cress leaves absorb more far-red light, the phytochrome molecule changes shape leading to a cascade of reactions that produce proteins related to growth away from the shade.

Chlorophyll from competing plants strongly absorbs blue light, so a reduction in blue light is a reliable indication that sunlight is being blocked.\n"}, {"Source": "staphylococcus aureus bacteria's membrane", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent cellular rupture", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/water-channels-prevent-cellular-rupture/", "Strategy": "Water Channels Prevent Cellular Rupture\n\nProteins embedded in the membranes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria open up to form relief channels in response to extreme internal water pressure.\n\nCertain conditions, such as exposure to a sudden downpour, can cause the influx of large amounts of water into a living cell.

Photosynthesis proceeds most rapidly in Rhizophora at a temperature of 25°C, falling off sharply above 35°C. The optimal temperature is typical of the air temperature within a mangrove forest. However, to maximise photosynthesis a leaf must position itself broadside-on to the sun. Maximising incident light, unfortunately, also maximises heat gain, and the temperature of a leaf in this position rapidly rises to 10–11°C above air temperature. One way of reducing leaf temperature would be to increase the transpiration rate and lose heat by evaporation. Mangroves cannot afford to do this. Instead, they tend to hold their leaves at an angle to the horizontal, so minimising heat gain. The angle varies from about 75° in leaves with greatest exposure to the sun, to 0° (horizontal) in leaves in full shade. Cooling is also enhanced by leaf design. Small leaves lose more heat by convection than large ones: leaves exposed to full sunlight, and heat-stressed, are smaller than those that are shaded.

Since the normal function of spicules is to stiffen tissue (although we’re still considering relatively unstiff structures), she used that as a criterion of effectiveness. Even a relatively small proportion of spicules dramatically increases stiffness; more spicules or more elongate or irregularly shaped spicules give more stiffness, and small spicules are more effective than are large ones for a given added mass.

These natives of Central and South America generally parasitize other birds in the same family, the icterids. They particularly favor the huge, pendulous, colonial nests of the chestnut-headed oropendola (Psarocolius cassini). However, the precise nature of the relationship between them depends on the location of the hosts’ nests.\n\n“In certain nests, the oropendolas do not discriminate between their own eggs and those of the cowbird, nor do they display aggression toward the cowbird. And the cowbird makes no attempt to lay its eggs secretly in these oropendolas’ nests. It will evict a female oropendola to lay its own eggs there. In this instance, the eggs laid by the cowbird are numerous and different in appearance from those of the oropendolas. Yet they are not rejected.\n\n“Other oropendolas, however, are aggressive toward the cowbird and will reject the egg if they notice its presence. Because of this the cowbird will lay only a single egg in the nest and does so secretly, while the oropendolas are away. A cowbird egg laid in such circumstances could blend in unnoticed with the oropendola’s own eggs. The reason for these two very different scenarios has recently been revealed.\n\n“Researchers discovered that when the oropendolas are not aggressive toward the cowbird and readily rear its young with their own, the young cowbirds are serving a useful purpose. They devour botflies that would otherwise lay parasitic eggs in the nests, and even groom their young oropendola nest-mates, removing any botfly larvae that may have evaded detection. In this case, therefore, the association between cowbird and oropendola is more symbiotic that parasitic, because both partners benefit.\n\n“Conversely, where the oropendolas are aggressive to the cowbird and can tell their own eggs from those of the cowbird, the researchers invariably found that these particular oropendola nests were situated close to bee or wasp nests: botflies avoid areas containing bee or wasp nests. In this scenario, therefore, since there are no botflies to eliminate, the young cowbird serves no useful purpose for the oropendola.

The availability of their preferred algae can change dramatically and repeatedly over the iguanas’ lifetimes. When El Niño weather events cause the temperature and freshwater influx into the ocean to increase, they disrupt currents that normally bring nutrient-rich water up from the ocean depths, and foster the growth of the iguana’s preferred algae. During these events many iguanas starve. However, many other survive, due to an unexpected and remarkable adaptation.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen the iguana’s food source decreases, many iguanas get smaller in size, by as much as 20% of their regular length. By decreasing in size, iguanas increase the relative benefit of the available food. In larger animals, a greater proportion of food calories just go to maintaining existing biomass, leaving less for energetic activities (such as foraging). Smaller iguanas thus feed more efficiently than larger iguanas.\n\nBecause cartilage and connective tissue only account for about 10% of body length, it appears the shrinking in iguanas is also due to a loss of bone tissue. Moreover, when the food supply increases again, iguanas regain their original length, apparently rapidly rebuilding their bones.

These threads are elastomeric fibers that enable the mussel to attach to hard surfaces.\n\n“Matthew Harrington, a researcher who worked on the project…explains the motivation for studying the byssus cuticle: ‘Protective coatings are important for prolonging the lifetime of materials and devices. However, considering that hardness and extensibility are seldom coupled in engineered polymers or composites, understanding how one protects a flexible substrate becomes quite important.’ Byssal cuticles have a knobby appearance due to inclusions of submicron-sized granular structures in an apparently continuous matrix. Submicron-sized tears that form in the matrix during stretching of the cuticle are believed to hinder the formation of larger cracks that could lead to material failure.\n\nCentral to understanding the peculiar mechanical behaviour of the cuticle are the high concentration of iron ions in the cuticle and the presence of an uncommon modification of the amino acid tyrosine known commonly as dopa. Dopa is found at high concentrations in the main cuticle component, mussel foot protein-1 (mfp-1). Dopa is distinguished from typical amino acids due to its impressive affinity for complexing with transition metal ions, particularly iron. As Admir Masic, a scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Colloids and Interfaces who worked on the project, explains, ‘when 2-3 dopa residues complex with a single iron ion, they create an incredibly stable complex that can be utilized to cross-link structural proteins.’ These metal-protein complexes have a high breaking force (nearly half that of covalent bonds), but unlike covalent bonds they are reversibly breakable, making them ideal for creating sacrificial cross-links.”"}, {"Source": "acidiphilium cryptum bacteria's respiratory enzymes", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "detoxify hexavalent chromium", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/biochemical-pathways-detoxify-hexavalent-chromium/", "Strategy": "Biochemical Pathways Detoxify Hexavalent Chromium\n\nRespiratory enzymes in Acidiphilium cryptum bacteria detoxify hexavalent chromium compounds even under highly acidic conditions by shuttling electrons from several sources.\n\nHexavalent chromium is a known carcinogen and may also cause mutations and birth defects.

These insects live for more than a decade underground, sucking only sap from plant roots. And plant sap is a notoriously poor food source, lacking most of the amino acids cicadas need to survive.\n\nFortunately, cicadas have partners in the digestive department. Some of their cells contain two species of bacteria that together can use that sappy junk food to make the protein building blocks cicadas need in order to live long enough to emerge from their underground hideaways to make more cicadas.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nMillions of years ago, harmless bacteria invaded the cells of cicadas’ ancestors. These bacteria evolved into two species, Candidatus Sulcia muelleri and Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola that only live inside specialized cells called bacteriocytes found in the cicada’s body. The cicadas provide the bacteria with the molecules (mainly water with a few carbohydrates and other nutrients) the cicadas gather from root sap. The bacteria disassemble those molecules into smaller molecules. Then they reassemble them into the 10 amino acids cicadas need to live and grow, and they do so in a very complementary manner: Candidatus Sulcia muelleri produces eight of the needed molecules, and Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola handily manufactures the other two, as well as additional essential vitamins such as B12. The cicadas harvest the resulting amino acids, leaving the bacteria with enough of what they need to thrive, too.\n\nBefore a female cicada lays her eggs, some of the bacteria move into the oocytes, or egg cells. That allows them to colonize—and eventually feed—the next generation of underground sapsuckers.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe mutually beneficial relationship between cicadas and bacteria suggest opportunities for improving the nutritional value of food by bringing bacteria into the picture. For instance, it might suggest a strategy for incorporating protein building blocks into laboratory-grown meat substitutes. Or it might be adapted for engineering food plants such as carrots or potatoes that currently do not provide all of the amino acids we need so that they can become a nutritionally complete protein source, reducing the demand for meat and the environmental costs of producing it.\n\nThe notion of cooperating and providing mutual benefits for mutual gain also offers a valuable lesson for life in general.

If it’s dry, pine cones on the ground will let down their slender scales and open up like the fingers of an unfurling fist. If rain and humidity are in the air, the scales will clamp up like a castle drawbridge, overlapping one another and sealing the cone into a tight ball.\n\nThe idea is simple—to open and release seeds when conditions are best for winds to carry them far and wide. Wet weather dampens dispersal.\n\nBut how do they “sense” humidity when pine cones contain no living cells? And how do they move without any muscles or nerves?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe secret lies in the structure of their scales. Pine cones have two layers made of different types of materials. The outermost side of the scale (which faces downward when the scales are open) is made of a layer of loosely packed, stretchable cells. The inner layer (facing upward when the scales are open) is made of stiff fibers tightly packed like cables.\n\nWhen the scales are open and the air becomes humid, water drops will begin to fall or bead on the fibrous upper layer. The water slides down toward the cone’s central stalk and is channeled into the scales’ lower layer. There, the water fills up the cells and the empty spaces between them. This layer expands and stretches, while the less flexible upper layer stays taut. The scales bend upward in the middle until they curl completely shut.\n\nWhen humidity levels reach around 20 percent, it takes just a one-percent change in humidity to trigger the scales to close. Then, when the air becomes drier, water in the scales evaporates, the outer layer shrinks back in size, and the scales reopen.\n\nThe Potential\n\nPine cones’ effective, sensitive, water-driven scheme is inspiring engineers to design mechanisms that can move and/or change shape without needing energy input. Such innovations could lead to novel systems to transport water, or on a smaller scale, to serve as activation switches for robotics.\n\nScientists are also exploring new materials that quickly respond to environmental changes. “Smart” fabrics could react automatically to changing temperatures or humidity. When the fabric gets wet from sweat or humidity, layers in the fabric could open up and make it more breathable. When conditions dry out, the material could revert to its original tight knit weave.\n\nSimilarly inspired building materials might also respond to changing humidity. In dry, warm midday air, self-adjusting blinds, for example, might bend to create shade and keep houses cool. At night through humid early mornings, they would relax and open up again.\n\nVideo Pine cone scales unfurl to disperse seeds via the wind. But when humidity rises, the scales close again to prevent seeds from dispersing in unfavorable weather conditions."}, {"Source": "wood ant's nest", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "maximize solar heat absorption", "Function2": "regulate nest temperature", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nest-maximizes-solar-heat-absorption/", "Strategy": "Nest Maximizes Solar Heat Absorption\n\nWood ants maximize solar heat absorption by their nest via the optimum angle of orientation.\n\n“The surface of the nest of wood ants (Formica rufa) has numerous holes which serve as entrances and ventilation holes; at night and in cold weather the ants plug the holes to keep heat in.

But because its blossom began forming the previous growing season, when it’s finally freed from frost sometime in July, the plant is ready to go.\n\nShortly after emerging—and often while still surrounded by snow—it blooms and begins to attract bees. This quick response allows it to complete its reproductive cycle and produce mature seed in the few short weeks between snowmelt and the beginning of the next winter season.\n \nThe Strategy\n\nThe dwarf snowbell uses multiple adaptations to fit its reproductive cycle into such a short season. Beginning in the summer, it forms its flower buds, which then spend the first part of the winter dormant under the snow, poised to grow. It also stores bountiful amounts of sugar, which will provide energy for survival, growth, and development in the absence of sun.\n\nAs air temperatures plummet below freezing, it uses the insulating properties of snow to maintain its temperature at or near a tolerable 32 °F (0 °C), avoiding tissue damage from internal ice crystals.\n\nAnd remarkably, the dwarf snowbell doesn’t rely on external cues such as daylength—which would not be helpful under such heavy snow cover—to determine when to start developing its blossom. Rather, it uses an internal clock whose workings are not yet fully understood. Once the snow is reduced to a depth of 6 inches (15 centimeters) or so, the plant’s reddish flower stalk and pink flower absorb and radiate sunlight onto the snow around the plant. Thanks to the plant’s short stature, that heat then creates a warm patch in its immediate vicinity that helps the remaining snow covering the plant to melt.\n\nOnce the snow is reduced to a depth of 6 inches (15 centimeters) or so, the plant’s reddish flower stalk and pink flower absorb and radiate sunlight onto the snow around the plant\n\nWhen the dwarf snowbell is finally free from the snow, it has yet one more adaptation that comes into play. Both the flower stalk and flower are spring-loaded, so the stalk can quickly go from its horizontal position under the snow to a vertical position that helps it attract the bumblebees that pollinate it.\n\nShould the flowers for some reason fail to emerge in time, the dwarf snowbell has a backup plan: it will reproduce vegetatively, creating clones of itself."}, {"Source": "guillemot's egg", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent falling off", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/egg-shape-prevents-falls/", "Strategy": "Egg Shape Prevents Falls\n\n“Some marine birds, such as the guillemot, which lives in northern seas, lay their pear-shaped eggs without the shelter of a nest directly onto the bare windy rock ledge of the rookery.

When one alights, it inevitably sticks to a hair. As it struggles, it touches other hairs and becomes further entangled. Neighbouring hairs, even if they have not been touched, are able to sense that a catch has been made and they bend towards it. If the insect is a large one and has been caught near the edge of the leaf, the hairs will lean over and convey the captive towards the centre. There, a whole group of hairs arch over it.

And the light these collisions produce travels along invisible magnetic field lines that wrap Earth in a spaghetti network called the magnetosphere.\n\nWhen high energy particles collide with molecules in our atmosphere, the northernand southern lights ignite the sky along Earth’s fluctuating magnetic field lines. \n\nThe magnetosphere exists because our planet is a giant magnet. Scientists think electric currents generated by molten metal lava in the earth’s outer crust creates the field. We’re lucky it exists because it blocks out high levels of radiation that would otherwise penetrate our atmosphere and wreak havoc on all life. It also enables us to orient ourselves on the landscape using compasses.\nSome of the first forms of life on Earth also made use of this phenomenon and evolved to have tiny, nanoscale compass needles embedded inside them.

The crystals vary in length from 35 to 120 nanometers, and each type of bacteria usually makes either magnetite (Fe3O4) or greigite (Fe3S4). Scientists have discovered only one type of bacteria that makes both crystal types. The shapes of the crystals vary across organisms but are usually cubes, rectangular prisms, or pointed forms.\n"}, {"Source": "mosquito's hair on antennae", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "move hairs", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hydration-used-to-move-hairs/", "Strategy": "Hydration Used to Move Hairs\n\nThe hairs on the antennae of some male mosquitoes are elevated by hydrating protein pads adjacent to each hair socket.\n\n“At least one case of motion driven by hydration occurs in animals–the mechanism with which the males of at least one genus of mosquitoes erect the hairs on their antennae (Nijhout and Sheffield 1979).

Thus the force of surface tension rises sharply as an alveolus inflates, opposing further inflation.

Spittle bugs use recycled sap from grass stems converted to a soapy liquid that they pump into foamy bubbles using their tails…Frog eggs and spittle bug bubbles self-cushion when packed in an array and naturally leave little air amongst them. This is because nature’s bubbles join according to three principles of soap bubble geometry. First, a compound bubble consists of flat or smoothly curved surfaces joined together. Second, the surfaces meet in only two ways: either three surfaces merge along a curve (edge), or six surfaces at a vertex. Third, when surfaces come together at a curve, or curves and surfaces at a point, they do so at equal angles.

Oilbirds breed and roost in caves, often at sufficient depth that no daylight can penetrate, and forage for fruits at night. Using standard microscopy techniques we investigated the retinal structure of oilbird eyes and used an ophthalmoscopic reflex technique to determine the parameters of these birds’ visual fields. The retina is dominated by small rod receptors (diameter 1.3±0.2 μm; length 18.6±0.6 μm) arranged in a banked structure that is unique among terrestrial vertebrates. This arrangement achieves a photoreceptor density that is the highest so far recorded (≈1,000,000 rods mm–2) in any vertebrate eye. Cone photoreceptors are, however, present in low numbers. The eye is relatively small (axial length 16.1±0.2 mm) with a maximum pupil diameter of 9.0±0.0 mm, achieving a light-gathering capacity that is the highest recorded in a bird (f-number ≈1.07). The binocular field has a maximum width of 38° and extends vertically through 100° with the bill projecting towards the lower periphery; a topography that suggests that vision is not used to control bill position. We propose that oilbird eyes are at one end of the continuum that juxtaposes the conflicting fundamental visual capacities of sensitivity and resolution. Thus, while oilbird visual sensitivity may be close to a maximum, visual resolution must be low. This explains why these birds employ other sensory cues, including olfaction and echolocation, in the control of their behaviour in low-light-level environments.”\n\n“Within caves, and above the tree canopy at night, oilbirds would seem well equipped to detect the lowest light levels that may occur there and hence be able to use vision for general orientation, but not for tasks involving high spatial resolution. This general orientation is perhaps complemented by tactile cues from the prominent rictal bristles (Fig. 1a) at close range.

But it’s not really fiction. In the real world, cephalopods such as cuttlefish can use dynamic camouflage to blend in with their surroundings on demand. No matter the background, in a matter of seconds, poof, they’re gone.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nCuttlefish are able to match colors and surface textures of their surrounding environments by adjusting the pigment and iridescence of their skin, which is composed of several layers.\n\nOn the skin surface, chromatophores (tiny sacs filled with red, yellow, or brown pigment) ab¬sorb light of various wavelengths. Once vis¬ual input is processed, the cephalopod sends a signal to a nerve fiber, which is connected to a muscle. That muscle relaxes and contracts to change the size and shape of the chromato¬phore. Each color chromatophore is controlled by a different nerve, and when the attached muscle contracts, it flattens and stretches the pigment sack outward, expanding the color on the skin. When that muscle relaxes, the chro¬matophore closes back up, and the color dis¬appears. As many as two hundred of these may fill a patch of skin the size of a pencil eraser, like a shimmering pixel display.\n\nThe innermost layer of skin, composed of leuc¬ophores, reflects ambient light. These broadband light reflectors give the cephalopods a ‘base coat’ that helps them match the brightness of their surroundings.\n\nBetween the colorful chromatophores and the light-scattering leucophores is a reflective lay¬er of skin made up of iridophores. Iridophores use structure to reflect incoming light, to take advantage of other colors provided by the environment. Iridophores selectively reflect light to create pink, yellow, green, blue, or silver coloration.\n\nThe combination of these skin layers allows cephalopods like the cuttlefish to blend in quickly with virtually any background.\n\nThe Potential\n\nTechnologies which control how much an object stands out or blends in have many different potential applications. “Smart” crosswalks, for example, could help to make crossing pedestrians more obvious to drivers and self-driving vehicles, and a truly smart phone being sought by its owner could change its color to contrast with the couch cushions it’s tucked between. The chromatophores of cuttlefish also give us the idea of materials that change colors with force or bending. This could be very helpful in everything from visual indicators of car tires getting low on air, to structural elements of bridges deforming and indicating they’re in need of repair."}, {"Source": "halobacteria", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "capture light energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pigments-photosynthesize-without-co2/", "Strategy": "Bacteria “Photosynthesize”\nWithout Chlorophyll\n\nHalobacteria produce chemical energy by capturing light energy with rhodopsin pigments and using it to pump protons out of the cell, setting up a proton gradient used to generate ATP.\n\n“Pumps and selective uptake devices need fuel – biological energy – and halobacteria, unlike Dunaliella, are not able to photosynthesise energy-yielding organic matter from carbon dioxide.

Rhizophora propagules generally float for some time before rooting themselves. Initially, floating is horizontal. Over a period of a a month or so they shift to a vertical position. This makes it more likely that the tip will drag in the mud surface and result in the propagule stranding when the tide recedes.

But they’re not the only ones in the animal kingdom that deserve admiration for their commitment to cooperation. Naked mole-rats show the same super-social behavior.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nBoth bees and naked mole-rats are eusocial. They live in multigenerational family groups with a single queen. All other individuals have specific jobs, either supporting the queen’s reproduction or fulfilling the colony’s daily survival needs, such as foraging and defense. This communal strategy helps the population survive in their unique ecological niche.\n\nThe naked mole-rat is a conspicuously hairless species of rodent that lives entirely underground in the driest regions of Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. Living in large colonies of up to 300 members, they have evolved remarkable abilities to survive in closed spaces. They can live for up to 18 minutes without oxygen and are unharmed by carbon dioxide levels many times higher than what’s found aboveground.\n\nIn a single group, there is usually only one dominant breeding female and a handful of breeding males. They divide their labor so that nonbreeding individuals become foragers, nest defenders or alloparents—adults that care for the young but are not the biological parents of those young.\n\nAlloparents huddle in the nest to create warmth for the mole-rat “pups,” retrieve pups that fall out of the nest, transport them when the colony moves to a new nest and evacuate them during colony disturbances. They also help feed the pups in a most unusual way. Young mole-rats that are weaned off their true mother’s milk will eat their alloparents’ caecotrophes, or partially digested fecal pellets. That’s right—mole-rat pups eat their alloparents’ poop!\n\nSome researchers argue that naked mole-rats evolved eusociality because it is advantageous for animals living in an environment where food is scarce and hard to find. Imagine digging in random directions through loads of dirt until you stumble upon a tuber—better to have compatriots who will search in different areas and give a holler when they find something good. Others explain that eusociality increases the nest’s overall survival rate when nonbreeding workers stay at home to look after the pups. This ensures that their whole population continues to thrive even if some members don’t reproduce. And a recent theory puts more emphasis on the queen: When a breeding female can stay home instead of venturing out to find food, she can eat and give birth without risk of encountering a predator.\n\nThe Potential\n\nWhatever the evolutionary explanation, it is clear that eusociality is an effective survival strategy for naked mole-rats.

It is a thriving ecosystem, hosting a wide variety of plants and animals. The plants in such a wetland, however, face a major challenge—growing in soil so waterlogged that it’s harder for oxygen to reach their roots.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nPlants take in carbon dioxide through their leaves and use the carbon as material to build their structures. But they take in oxygen through their roots to provide energy to carry out growth and repair.\n\nEven though the roots of land plants are buried, they can extract oxygen from air pockets within the soil. Most of the oxygen enters the roots through diffusion, when molecules are driven to move from areas with higher concentrations to areas with lower ones. In very wet soil, this becomes much more difficult because oxygen diffusion in water is 10,000 times slower than in air. So reeds (such as the common reed, Phragmites australis) have developed another way to breathe that’s very similar to using a snorkel.\n\nAir enters into common reeds from broken stems or dead plants that are all connected via underwater structures called rhizomes. Many wetland plant species have rhizomes that grow horizontally just below the surface of the soil, with many stems growing up and many roots growing down. Air taken in through one broken stem or dead plant can reach other healthy sections through this network.\n\nThe oxygen-carrying air moves through gaps in the plant’s tissues, called aerenchyma. If glass beads poured into a cylindrical vase represented the cells inside a plant stem, the space between the beads would be the aerenchyma, which form when cells separate from one another or collapse.\n\nThrough flow draws air down into the broken stems of some reeds, sending oxygen from the stems down into the rhizomes.\n\nThe aerenchyma spaces rely on pressure gradients to drive the gasses from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. In some cases, air is drawn into living sections of the plant through the stomata (gas-exchange holes) of the leaf sheaths, sending oxygen from the stems down into the rhizomes (from where it can diffuse into the roots), and pushing stale air out of broken stems.\n\nIn other cases, broken stems of different heights create a passive ventilation system. This is because of the Bernoulli principle: the faster air moves, the lower its pressure becomes. Since air closer to the ground is slower due to friction and turbulence, the air around higher stems is faster, and has lower pressure. This pulls stale air out of the taller broken stems and draws oxygen-rich fresh air into the shorter broken stems.\n\nThe removal of stale air can be as important as the intake of fresh air. Gases like carbon dioxide (which roots produce via cellular respiration of oxygen) and ethylene are drawn upward from the roots, into the rhizomes, and eventually out into the air. Though plants form ethylene to act as a kind of hormone that influences growth, research shows that some plant roots thrive under low ethylene concentrations while higher concentrations can stunt their growth. Therefore, the ability of wetland plants to vent this gas can help them stay healthy and keep growing."}, {"Source": "eurasian diving bell spider", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "build an airy home", "Function2": "trap air bubble", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/spider-creates-underwater-air-tank/", "Strategy": "Spider Builds an Underwater Bubble House\n\nThe Eurasian diving bell spider uses silk and goo to make an airy home for itself beneath the surface of a pond.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMost spiders weave webs in open spaces to capture insects. When the European water spider weaves a web, however, it’s in a dramatically different setting, with a dramatically different function. Stretched between parts of underwater plants, this spider’s web holds a spider-sized bubble of air beneath the surface of a pond. It serves as both home base and a literal breath of fresh air for its weaver.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nA European water spider begins constructing its home under the surface of a pond or standing water in a wetland in much the same way land-living spiders build their webs: by extruding silken threads from spinnerets in its abdomen and fastening them to plants. It then moves back and forth between the anchors, first producing parallel strands and then crossing them with others. It lightly coats the threads with a protein-based goo it also produces from its body. Both the silk and the goo are hydrophilic, meaning they attract water. Together, they create a loosely woven sheet of spider material and water that traps air bubbles below instead of letting them rise to the surface.\n\nNow it’s time to gather some air. The spider swims to the surface, sticks the back end of its abdomen up in the air, and spreads its rear legs. The abdomen is covered with tiny, feather-shaped water-repelling hairs set into small grooves. As the spider submerges, the hairs trap air in a glistening bubble, which is held in place with the help of the legs. The spider carries the bubble beneath the web and releases it. The bubble rises until it reaches the web, but the thread and goo combo prevents it from going any farther. The spider goes back for more until eventually it builds up an air chamber big enough to provide the oxygen it needs.\n\nAs the spider breathes inside its bubble home it uses up oxygen. That causes oxygen trapped in the water around it to diffuse into the bubble, replacing what the spider depleted. Similarly, the high concentration of exhaled carbon dioxide inside diffuses out of the bubble into the surrounding water. If the oxygen concentration declines more rapidly than diffusion can replenish, the spider simply returns to the surface to grab some more bubbles.\""}, {"Source": "ray-finned fish's skin", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "alter color", "Function2": "produce skin patterns", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pigment-granules-assist-hiding/", "Strategy": "Pigment Granules Assist Hiding\n\nSkin of ray-finned fish changes color in response to light levels and patterns via movement of granules in pigment cells.\n\n“Many fish in the teleost group, such as the minnow, change colour in response to the overall reflectivity of their background.

These webs have remarkable physical properties and are capable of withstanding impacts from comparatively large prey insects travelling at high speeds. When an insect hits a web, the strands stretch and deform to absorb the energy without tearing and then rebound to their original position ready for the next impact. In order for prey to remain trapped, the web threads are also coated in a sticky glue with remarkable properties.\n\nOrb-weaver web glue contains glycoproteins, that is, proteins that have carbohydrate (or sugar) attached to them. These carbohydrate groups mean the glue can form large numbers of hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds are very weak bonds, however, very large numbers of such weak forces can multiply up to form very strong interactions. In the case of orb-weaver web glue, there are lots of hydrogen bonding opportunities on a single glycoprotein, lots of glycoproteins in a single glue droplet, lots of droplets on a web strand, and lots of strands in a web. The combination of so many weak bonds at every hierarchical level results in very strong total interaction between prey and web and ensures potential food is not bounced off as the web rebounds.\n\nAs well as glycoproteins, glue droplets also contain high concentrations of salts. These salts are hygroscopic (they absorb moisture from the atmosphere), keeping the glue proteins wet. This enables the glycoproteins to move around inside the droplet, forming and reforming bonds. As a result, when an impact with a flying insect occurs, the glue also behaves elastically, stretching out and absorbing the impact energy without becoming detached from the web, before rebounding back to the droplet configuration, coating the hapless insect and effectively trapping it.\n\nDifferent species of spider have different salts and salt concentrations in their glue droplets that are tuned to the humidity of their native habitats. Man-made glues become less effective under high humidity, but orb-weaver glues use the salts to tune how much water they absorb from the atmosphere, enabling them to become even more sticky in the presence of moisture."}, {"Source": "cloud forest", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "absorb water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/trees-absorb-water-directly-from-clouds/", "Strategy": "Trees Absorb Water Directly From Clouds\n\nTrees in cloud forests cope with the dry season by absorbing water from clouds directly through their leaves.\n\nPlants need water to survive.

Pollen collection is carried out only by female bees, which have specialized body parts that enable them to collect and transport pollen grains back to the nest. Modified parts of the female bee’s hind legs, for instance, are used to collect and store pollen externally. These structures are rows of small hairs (called scopae) or flattened plates rimmed with curved hairs (called corbicula) that function like brushes and baskets that can hold the dust-like pollen grains in place while the bee forages.\n\nThe size of pollen grains from different flowers can range from 5 to 210 μm, and pollen grain surfaces can similarly vary in their structure and texture. As a result, many species of bees specialize on a narrow range of flower types and pollen. The density and bushiness of the bees’ scopal hairs have been shaped through co-evolution to function best with specific sizes and shapes of pollen.\n\nOther bees, however, can be more flexible in the types of pollen they collect. One strategy that enables this flexibility is mixing collected pollen with liquid, in the form of nectar, saliva, or floral oils. Moistening the pollen as it’s collected enables the grains to be packed and shaped together into a more concentrated package. Pollen-collecting structures on the bee’s legs needn’t be specialized to transport individual pollen grains; they can be more simplified and transport packages consisting of any size and shape of pollen. Female mining bees (of the family Andrenidae), for example, add nectar to their pollen to moisten it.

The gall provides both food and protection for the insect, but living in an enclosed space presents unique challenges that their free-living relatives don’t experience.\n\nAphids feed on sugar-rich sap from their host plant and excrete a viscous, sugary liquid called honeydew. They must dispose of this sticky waste product or risk becoming covered in it. Honeydew is particularly hard to handle at small length scales, where surface tension dominates over gravitational forces. If the sticky substance spreads, it can drown the aphid or present an ideal environment for the growth of harmful pathogens. Free-living aphids can fling the honeydew away or move to another location, but gall-dwelling aphids have to use another strategy to manage their waste.\n\nThe poplar spiral gall aphid (Pemphigus spyrothecae) is one species of social aphid that lives in colonies in spiral-shaped galls on black poplar. This aphid secretes a powdery, hydrophobic (water-repelling) wax from special cells on the outer surface of its abdomen. The wax is initially secreted as small threads that arrange into skeins about 10-20 μm in diameter, which then break down into a fine filamentous powder.  It has yet to be fully characterized, but comprises a mixture of compounds similar to candle wax. This powder coats the gall’s interior walls, creating a microtextured surface that, due to its physical structure and chemical composition, is hydrophobic. When an aphid excretes honeydew, the droplet is coated in wax strands it produces at the same time. The droplets are then covered with additional powdery wax as they get moved around inside the gall. Wax-coated droplets don’t stick to the aphid or gall walls, and can be disposed of simply by rolling them out of the gall opening.\n\nThe wax-covered honeydew droplets form spheres of liquid called “liquid marbles” that can easily roll around on a smooth surface and not wet it.

A single source of protein is not enough to fulfill the honeybee’s dietary needs, so a habitat that offers pollen sources from a variety of plants is ideal. A honeybee colony overridden by disease likely does not have access to the food resources it needs to sustain immune function, which can indicate that the bees live in a degraded ecosystem.\n\nThe impact of a diverse diet on the honeybee’s immunity can be measured through its blood cell concentration, fat body content, phenoloxidase activity and glucose oxidase (GOX) activity.\n\nThe first three measures relate to the immune function of individuals. Blood cell concentration and phenoloxidase activity measure a bee’s ability to identify, trap, and remove parasites. Fat bodies are where antimicrobial peptides are made.\n\nThe fourth measure relates to the colony as a whole. GOX allows a colony to be sterilized through the production of hydrogen peroxide, which has antiseptic properties. These antiseptic products are secreted into honey and other larval food.\n\nExperimentally, it has been shown that increasing the amount of protein in a honeybee’s diet did not significantly improve its immunity, but increasing the diversity of the honeybee’s diet did.\n\nBiological Strategy\n\nEnvironmental Disturbance Promotes Diversity Wet prairie ecosystem \n\nGrasses of wet prairies in South Florida thrive by being adapted to fire during the growing season.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe decline of honey bees has been attributed to many different causes, including susceptibility to disease due to weakened immune systems. The understanding that the diversity of food sources is important for individual and colony immunity can lead to new treatments and management styles to improve the health of honeybees everywhere.\n\nIn addition, the specific chemistry of honeybee health could inspire new therapies for bees, other invertebrates, and other animals as well.\n\nFinally, a closer examination of the interplay between individual and colony immune functions could lead to insights for better management of the health of other communities, including human ones.\n"}, {"Source": "puss moth caterpillar's tail filament", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from predator", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/squirting-toxins-protect-from-predators/", "Strategy": "Squirting Toxins Protect From Predators\n\nTail filaments of Puss Moth caterpillars protect from predators by squirting formic acid.\n\n“The pussmoth caterpillar browses head-down on leaves.

Unlike its relative the brown pelican, the American white pelican rarely plunge-dives for food. It typically swims on the surface of the water and grabs or scoops up fish and other prey with its pouch-shaped bill.\n\nOne strategy that these pelicans can use to increase their catch is cooperative feeding. In cooperative feeding behavior, groups of pelicans (usually less than 20) work together while swimming to herd small schooling fish into a dense ball or toward shallow water, where it’s difficult to escape. This behavior can start when the presence of pelicans attracts more pelicans to the area and a group forms. The pelicans then form a line or semicircle on one side of the schooling fish and begin to swim toward each other, closing in on the school. Once one pelican strikes at a fish in the dense school, the other birds immediately begin to strike, as well.\n\nSome researchers have observed that smaller groups of pelicans (between two and six) are the most successful at catching prey using this cooperative herding behavior. The most effective group size likely depends on several factors, including prey density and whether too many birds increases the chance of a premature strike that could scare fish away."}, {"Source": "striped anemone's tentacles", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "recognize specific molecules", "Function2": "trigger cellular activities", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/stinging-cells-target-prey/", "Strategy": "Stinging Cells Target Prey\n\nStinging cells of sea anemones effectively target prey using a combination of physical and chemical cues.\n\nIntroduction \n\nSea anemones are soft, spineless marine animals that mostly stay attached to underwater surfaces. An anemone resembles an upside-down jellyfish: they have a stout cylindrical body topped with a circular array of tentacles surrounding the mouth. Anemones feed and defend themselves with their tentacles, which contain numerous stinging cells called cnidocytes. A hair-like trigger projects from the cnidocyte, and when this trigger is touched, the stinging cell ejects a tiny toxin-filled or sticky harpoon (called a cnida or nematocyst) into the offending object. While cnidocytes are typically triggered by physical touch, a blind and immobile anemone can differentiate between a falling inedible pebble and swimming tasty prey.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIn the striped anemone, Diadumene lineata, the tentacles specialized for capturing prey are sensitive to specific chemicals that prey produce. For instance, small prey animals like crustaceans and fish are covered in a thin layer of mucus. This mucus contains specific molecules recognized by chemical-sensing cells (chemoreceptors) in the anemone’s tentacles. When mucus activates the chemoreceptors, this triggers a series of cellular activities in and around the cnidocyte that eventually cause the hair-like trigger to lengthen. This lengthening causes the hair to vibrate, or resonate, more readily at lower frequencies, much like how longer strings in a piano play lower notes. The hair-like trigger seems to become more sensitive to lower-frequency movements that match the frequencies at which small prey swim. In the absence of mucus, the hair-like trigger is normally sensitive to higher-frequency movements. The anemone’s chemoreceptors thus fine-tune how cnidocytes respond to physical touch. Cnidocytes are more likely to fire when the object moving through the tentacles is a mucus-covered swimming prey."}, {"Source": "red mangrove forest", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect shorelines", "Function2": "slow down and scatter wave energy", "Function3": "reduce wave energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/mangrove-forests-calm-coastal-waters/", "Strategy": "Mangrove Forests Calm Coastal Waters\n\nRoots of red mangrove forests protect coastal shorelines by absorbing energy from waves.\n\nClimate change is bringing stronger and more intense storms to coastal areas across the world. Powerful storm surges and other types of large waves carry enormous amounts of energy. When they wash up on a shoreline, they can cause rapid erosion, major damage to buildings, and loss of human life. Mangrove forests can protect shorelines from damage by powerful waves. The forests’ layered architecture helps to slow down and scatter wave energy so that it loses power before it reaches the shore.\n\nAlso called mangrove swamps, these dense ecosystems occur in tropical and sub-tropical coastal waters. They are dominated by tree and shrub species that have unusual root shapes. For example, “prop roots,” or “stilt roots,” look like multiple legs branching out from the base of the tree trunk, anchoring the tree in the soil. Other species have “knee roots” emerging like bent knees from the soil. They anchor the tree and also help the main roots, nestled in oxygen poor soils, to get oxygen. A third type of roots are tall finger-shaped growths poking out of the soil near the main plant. These are called pneumatophores, and also aid in gas exchange. A wave rolling into a mangrove forest at high speed is met by a dense tangle of obstacles and it loses more and more energy as it gets sliced up by all the hurdles in its path. Scientists found that a wave can lose up to two-thirds of its energy after moving just 100 meters into a mangrove forest. The further it travels through the mangrove forest, the more energy it loses. The special root structures create so much friction and drag on the water that when the wave finally reaches the shoreline it has often been reduced to a gentle ripple.\n\nHow much the wave slows down depends on how high it is, of course. Because the obstacles of the mangrove forest are close to the ground, they might not have as much of an effect on higher, more powerful waves. The forest canopy, however, can have the same type of effect as the mangrove roots on an incoming wave. Waves that are high enough to reach the height of the canopy – with its thick trunks, sprawling branches, and numerous leaves – get broken up and dissipated much the same way that shallow waves do. Overall, the dense mangrove ecosystem and forest canopy can be very beneficial to shoreline communities by helping to protect them during storms.\n"}, {"Source": "hagfish slime", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "enable rapid slime formation", "Function2": "withstand and transfer pulling forces", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/mucin-strands-enable-rapid-slime-formation/", "Strategy": "Mucin Strands Enable Rapid Slime Formation\n\nMucin strands in hagfish slime enable rapid slime formation by transmitting forces from flowing water.\n\nHagfishes are marine fishes that are infamous for their slime. When threatened by a biting predator, a hagfish responds by releasing small amounts of thick slime concentrate out of glands lining its body (see the related strategy here). This slime concentrate then explodes into a ~1L volume of dilute slime in a fraction of a second. What enables this rapid slime formation?\n\nMucins are protein and carbohydrate molecules that partly make up mucus. Hagfish slime contains thin protein threads interspersed in a dilute mucus. In the slime concentrate, those protein threads are initially wound up into 150 μm-long bundles (skeins). Part of the rapid slime expansion in seawater involves those skeins unraveling into threads 100 times longer. For the Atlantic hagfish, Myxine glutinosa, these threads won’t deploy on their own: active mixing and mucins are needed to enable thread unraveling. Hagfish slime mucins are contained within membrane-bound vesicles that are ~7 μm long, and these vesicles are released along with the thread skeins in the slime concentrate.\n\nOne leading model for how whole slime forms in the Atlantic hagfish proposes that mucins swell and elongate into sticky strands when they come into contact with seawater. Ions and water rushing into the mucin vesicles cause them to swell, while fluid flow forces cause them to stretch. The mucin strands then attach to the thread skeins at multiple points, creating interconnected networks. The mucins are malleable enough to stretch and strong enough to withstand and transfer pulling forces between the flowing water and thread skeins. The threads, which are still wound up when mucin attaches, are unravelled by disruptive forces transmitted from the actively mixing water by the mucin strands.\nBiologists are still uncovering how slime forms in other species of hagfish. In the Atlantic hagfish’s Pacific relative, Eptatretus stoutii, thread skeins can spontaneously unravel on their own. As vigorous thrashing often accompanies sliming during a predator attack, however, most hagfish naturally provide the mixing needed to form a large mass of slime."}, {"Source": "ant colony", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "distribute food", "Function2": "quickly respond to food shortage", "Function3": "endure and recover from distress", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ant-colonies-respond-quickly-to-distribute-food/", "Strategy": "Ant Colonies Respond\nQuickly to Distribute Food\n\nAnt colonies distribute food effectively and safely after famine using a decentralized response to quickly spread food.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA society consists of individuals, each with its own role, in a structured community. A society can be centralized or decentralized. A centralized society consists of a single individual or group of individuals that function as a type of “control center.” This control center has the power to plan and control how the society works. They make decisions first and then they distribute this information to other members of the society. However, in this system it takes time to make group decisions and assign tasks.\n\nOn the other hand, a decentralized society does not have a control center. Instead, individuals make decisions independently or in small groups. This allows individuals to act more quickly because information does not have to go through a centralized group first.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAnt colonies are an example of a decentralized society. An ant can have interactions with nearby individuals, or take cues from the local environment to help make its decisions. For example, ants who have found food can quickly direct other ants to it without needing to check with the ‘control center’ first. They signal to other ants about where food is by emitting chemical signals from their bodies known as pheromones. Other ants will follow this signal, which will lead them to the food source. This decentralized response enables ants to act quickly and allows for resiliency, which is the ability to endure and recover from distress. An ant’s response to food shortages or famine is an example of resiliency.\n\nAn ant can have interactions with nearby individuals, or take cues from the local environment to help make its decisions . . . without needing to check with the ‘control center’ first.\n\nAnts can experience food shortages for a variety of reasons. For example, bad weather can disrupt a food source or other ant colonies can compete for the same food source. When ants in a famine find food, they quickly spread it to other ants living in the same nest. Normally, ants each have their own roles in the colony. These roles are completed within the limited areas of the nest. However, when a famine occurs, the ants can move anywhere in the nest to help spread food. In order to feed everyone quickly, foragers (the ants who collect food) move deeper into the nest to pass food to more individuals. Ants that take care of the young usually live deep in the nest. In times of famine, they move to the edges of the nest to receive food from foragers more quickly.\n\nBecause ants need to find and spread food quickly during a famine, they often settle for a lower quality of food, which sometimes may contain harmful chemicals. Ants normally wouldn’t eat these foods, but one way to reduce the chances of eating harmful food is to have multiple food sources. Multiple foragers will travel out in different directions from the nest to find different food sources during a famine. Having multiple food sources dilutes harmful chemicals coming from one particular source. Another solution is to use living “silos” where an individual ant stores and tests a food source for harmful chemicals. The ant may die, but the colony would be saved from a food source that was harmful. All of these are quick and coordinated decentralized responses by individual ants. Together, these actions help a colony survive famine."}, {"Source": "striped kribensis fish (pelvicachromis taeniatus)", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "visualize near-infrared wavelength of light", "Function2": "see beyond red", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/the-fish-that-see-in-the-dark/", "Strategy": "The Fish That See in the Dark\n\nSome fish visualize near-infrared wavelengths of light by feeding their red-light-sensing cone cells with vitamin A2.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAfter a long, hot day, the sun sets over the mountaintops staining the sky a deep crimson. Sunsets are red and orange because the sun’s light passes through more atmospheric gases when it’s low on the horizon. At these low elevations, air molecules scatter so much short-wavelength blue light that only longer red and orange wavelengths reach our eyes. Red is actually the longest wavelength on the “visible spectrum,” defined as the range of light that humans can see.\n\nBut many animals see beyond what we see. Some birds, butterflies, and bees see ultraviolet (UV) light, which has wavelengths shorter than the violet light that our retinae can detect. Scientists previously thought that infrared light was unsuitable for visual perception because its longer-than-red wavelengths would produce too much visual noise. But that turns out just to be an old fish story. Several animals, including the striped kribensis fish (Pelvicachromis taeniatus), manage to see beyond red very well indeed.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe rainbow arching across the sky is perhaps the most iconic illustration of the visible spectrum, with wavelengths of light ranging from 400 nanometers (violet) to 780 nanometers (red). Just beyond that lies a region of light called “near-infrared,” which encompasses wavelengths between 780 and 1,000 nanometers. Several types of freshwater fish are known to see near-infrared light.\n\nTo understand how fish see such long wavelengths of light, we need to understand a bit about the process that enables humans, fish, and other vertebrates to see at all—phototransduction. In this process, light passes into the pupil, focuses across the eye’s lens, and strikes the retina, which contains hundreds of millions of photoreceptor cells. Like other sensing receptor cells, these cells convert information to electric signals that the brain can interpret.\n\nPhotoreceptor cells come in two different shapes, each with a distinct role in vision. Rod-shaped photoreceptors help with light contrast and allow us to see at lower light levels. Walking through a dark room, rod receptors help you navigate even if you can’t distinguish colors. At higher light levels, three types of cone-shaped photoreceptors—red, green, and blue—help us see colors because they’re sensitive to different wavelengths of light.\n\nLooking up on a clear day, blue cone receptors activate and stimulate nerve cells that cause our brains to perceive the sky as “blue.” In a forest in the spring, green receptors fire as we scan our eyes across leafy treetops. Focusing on a northern cardinal perched on a branch, red receptors alert our brains to the brilliant bird’s beauty. The three types of cone receptors work together to paint our brains’ perceptions with all the colors of the rainbow. As we take in different views, changes in the quantity, intensity, and duration at which the various cone receptors fire combine to create a “full color” image of the scene.\n\nVitamin A, which comes in two forms, is part of the protein complexes that make up the rod and cone cells. In humans and most other vertebrates, vitamin A1, commonly called retinol, is the dominant form. According to a 2015 study, some fish can see longer wavelengths of light because they have an enzyme that converts vitamin A1 to vitamin A2 (called dehydroretinol). Vitamin A2 appears to shift the sensitivity of red cone cells to longer wavelengths, allowing fish that have this particular enzyme to see near-infrared light."}, {"Source": "hissing cockroach's respiratory system", "Application": "air filtration designs", "Function1": "create one-way airflow", "Function2": "unidirectional airflow", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/body-pores-open-and-close-to-push-breath-through-cockroaches/", "Strategy": "Body Pores Open and Close to\nPush Breath Through Cockroaches\n\nThe respiratory system of the hissing cockroach creates one-way airflow using valves and active pumping.\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Madagascar hissing cockroach (Gromphadorhina portentosa ) is a large and active insect. During periods of activity, its relatively fast metabolism means that its tissues use a lot of oxygen and produce a lot of carbon dioxide. The passive process of diffusion alone cannot move these gases between the external atmosphere and the cockroach’s internal respiratory system, so it uses active ventilation to pump air into and out of its body.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIn all insects, the respiratory system consists of a network of branching tubes, called tracheae, that develop from inward folds of the insect’s exoskeleton. These tubes connect an insect’s internal, metabolizing tissues to the outside air via pores, called spiracles, that line both sides of the insect’s thorax (mid-section) and abdomen (rear section). Muscle-controlled valves enable the pores to open and close.\n\nIn the hissing cockroach, thoracic and abdominal pores appear to open and close at different times to help create a mostly one-way flow of air through the respiratory system from front to back. This is in contrast to the two-way airflow that mammalian lungs create, where air enters and exits through the same tubes.\n\nFor the hissing cockroach to breathe in, the abdominal pores close and the abdomen expands, which sucks oxygen-rich air in through the open thoracic pores. This air then travels through respiratory tubes and reaches the cockroach’s tissues. Oxygen is taken up, while carbon dioxide is released.\n\nTo breathe out and remove the carbon dioxide, the abdominal pores open and the abdomen contracts, which forces the spent air out of the abdominal pores. Abdominal contraction is actively powered by muscles, while expansion is a passive result of the abdomen relaxing and returning to its resting shape.\n\nConstricting tubes between the abdomen and thorax can help prevent backflow during contraction. This coordinated system of valves and pumps in the cockroach creates a cyclic, unidirectional airflow into the thoracic pores and out of the abdominal pores. In general, unidirectional airflow enables more efficient gas exchange because fresh air and spent air don’t mix together in the respiratory spaces.\n\nThe Potential\n\nStudying the unidirectional respiratory systems of hissing cockroaches could lead to more efficient ventilation and air filtration designs. Designs for medical equipment such as face masks, oxygen concentrating machines, and breathe-assist devices might also improve by emulating the coordinated pushing and pulling of air through cockroach body pores."}, {"Source": "lymph system", "Application": "dynamic coatings", "Function1": "pressure differences", "Function2": "muscle contractions", "Function3": "one-way valves", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/how-the-lymph-system-pumps-with-no-pump/", "Strategy": "How the Lymph System Pumps With No Pump\n\nThe lymphatic system uses pressure, muscle contractions, and one-way valves to squeeze fluid through a network of vessels without the need for a pump.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEven while wildflower blooms explode across the jagged landscape, patches of snow linger atop mountain crests. At 12,095 feet in elevation, Colorado’s Independence Pass stands along the Continental Divide—a mountainous line that separates water flow across the Americas. Down each slope, snowmelt drains through soil, vegetation, tributaries, lakes, and rivers in a tortuous path east towards the Atlantic Ocean or west towards the Pacific. Along the way, cities and towns siphon the water that people need to live. But before water reaches our faucets, we have to treat it for pollutants it may have picked up during its journey.\n\nOur bodies also need a drainage system to collect, treat, and recycle fluid that leaks into surrounding tissue. About 90% of the blood that supplies the body’s tissues with oxygen and nutrients returns to the heart via veins. But about 10% of it leaks across capillaries into the surrounding tissue. In vertebrates, the lymphatic system collects this spilled material along with cellular waste products within its own network of vessels and returns them to the circulatory system.\n\nThe lymph system also helps absorb dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. And it plays a role critical to our immunity. As fluid moves through lymphatic vessels, it passes through lymph nodes that contain high concentrations of lymphocytes (types of white blood cells), which attack pathogens like bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\n\nIn the circulatory system, the heart pumps the blood in a continuous loop. But without a  central “pump”, the lymph system must divide and conquer the task of moving its fluid.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nLymph fluid flows through the body using a combination of pressure differences, muscle contractions, and one-way valves.\n\nLike blood vessels, lymphatic capillaries permeate most of the body’s tissues. Lymphatic capillary cells overlap one another like the horizontal slats in closed window blinds. As fluid accumulates in tissue outside of lymphatic capillaries, the pressure increases and pushes on the overlapping cells, opening them slightly inwards. The waste material enters the lymphatic vessels through gaps, which relieves the external pressure. As the pressure outside the lymphatic capillaries reduces, the flaps close again, trapping the fluid inside.\n\nJust as water flows naturally from high to low pressure, higher pressure in the lymphatic capillaries propels fluid through the system. In addition, as surrounding muscles contract during motion, they compress lymphatic vessels and push the fluid forward. Complementing that, larger lymph vessels themselves have smooth muscle cells on their outer walls that help squeeze the vessels that propel the fluid. In contrast to the centralized collection of muscle cells that make up the heart, smooth muscle cells distributed throughout the lymphatic vessels contract only as needed—sometimes strongly and suddenly, and sometimes in a cascading wave.\n\nThroughout the system, one-way flap valves inside lymph vessels prevent backflow and keep the fluid moving in one direction—towards veins in the neck called subclavian veins. At the subclavian veins, the lymph waste products enter the bloodstream and can either be reused or filtered through the liver and kidneys.\n\nThe Potential\n\nInstead of using high-power pumps to transport fluids through long pipelines, dynamic coatings could mimic the effects of smooth muscle tissue inside lymph vessels. A system of one-way valves could reduce energy requirements, contributing to fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Perhaps drug delivery systems could rely on common muscle movements such as walking to spread medicine in specific parts of the body.

Many kinds of small molecules can diffuse across the cell’s outer membrane, or travel through special embedded channels. Taking in larger materials, however, requires a different strategy.\n\nOne strategy for capturing large materials is phagocytosis, or “cell eating.” Phagocytosis is a process where a cell engulfs whole particles by wrapping them in its own membrane before processing them internally. For instance, specialized cells of the immune system in humans can envelop invading microorganisms or dead cells whole using phagocytosis. These specialized cells first recognize an object to ingest when surface receptors on the cell bind to surface molecules on the object. The cell then sends membranous folds (called pseudopods) outward and around the object until it is completely enclosed. When the tips of the pseudopods meet, they fuse back together. This process is facilitated by strands of actin proteins, which can easily lengthen or shorten to enable cell movement. The fusion of the cell’s membrane folds creates an internal membranous compartment (a phagosome) containing the ingested object. Some single-celled organisms, like certain protozoa, use the same phagocytic process to ingest whole bacteria as food.\n\nIn both cases, the newly-bound object can be processed when the phagosome fuses with other internal compartments containing digestive enzymes.

But these massive creatures are barely fazed by the chill. They wander the ice. They build dens in the snow. They swim and dive and sleep under the stars––or the midnight sun. Part of the secret is their calorie-heavy diet of seal blubber. But equally important is their fur coat.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe coat is made up of two distinct layers: a short and dense underfur layer next to the skin, and an outer layer of longer and coarser guard hairs.\n\nThe guard hairs appear white, but are actually made up of a light-scattering translucent cylinder surrounding a chambered core. This sophisticated structure not only absorbs heat from the environment but also prevents the heat that radiates from the bear’s body from easily escaping into the air around it.\n\nWhen sunlight hits the hair, the outside reflects a small amount back into the environment, giving the bear a bright white appearance. Most of the light, however, travels through the translucent sheath, where it hits and is reflected by the core. Depending on the angle at which the light hits the core, it bounces around within the hair or it bounces out to another hair, where the process is repeated.\n\nSome of the light energy transforms into heat in the process. Some of it bounces deeper and deeper into the bear’s coat until it finally is absorbed by the bear’s black skin, which re-radiates it as heat. The tightly packed inner fur holds the heat close to the animal, helping to keep it warm.\n\nMany animals that live in cold climates have hair with a hollow core. In polar bear hair, the core’s chambers add extra insulating value.

Smaller, weedier plants typically grow first, priming the area for larger, more long-lived ones (like shrubs and trees). This type of multi-step succession occurs in Mediterranean montane forest environments as well, with “nurse” shrubs providing protected conditions for larger trees.\n\nThese nurse shrubs prepare the area in two ways: by creating a shaded environment and by depositing higher concentrations of potassium into the soil. The shaded environment promotes tree seedling growth through the canopy effect: a group of effects including lower air temperatures, lower soil temperatures, and higher water levels. All of these effects together help create the perfect environment for seedlings.\n\nSecond, nurse shrubs increase soil potassium concentrations by trapping windblown particles in their branches and by generating organic litter such as broken twigs and fallen leaves. During the dry season, when water is scarce, higher levels of potassium help protect the new tree saplings from drought by reducing transpiration rates (the plant equivalent of sweating). This accumulation of potassium reduces transpiration losses by affecting the osmotic gradient (the comparable concentrations of two solutions separated by a semipermeable membrane). By increasing the potassium levels within the plant, the gradient is increased, causing water to diffuse into the plant as it tries to maintain equal concentrations on each side of the membrane.

Numbats, however, are pouchless; babies simply cling to their mothers for six or seven months until they get too big to carry around.\n\nAnd while most marsupials are nocturnal, numbats are active exclusively during the day. That’s because of their diet. Unlike most marsupials, which generally eat plants, fruits, and sometimes insects, numbats are entirely carnivorous. More particularly, they are termitivorous. They eat nothing but termites, which come out by day.\n\nGiven their singular schedule and diet, numbats have had to adapt to maintain ideal body temperatures. A major way they do that is with another feature that sets them apart. Unlike most marsupials, which have thick fur coats, numbats have sparse pelts—which counterintuitively help regulate their body temperatures and keep them warm.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nSince numbats don’t get enough fuel from termites to maintain body heat, they rely on absorbing heat from the sun. Their pelts have shorter hairs and fewer hairs per square inch, compared with other marsupials and diurnal mammals. So their sparse coats are not made to insulate against the cold, but rather to expose more skin area to the sun, maximizing the amount of solar radiation they absorb.\n\nThey also make their pelt hairs stand up straight. The scientific term for this is piloerection. It happens to people when they get goosebumps.\n\nPiloerection traps layers of motionless body-heated air close to the skin surface. These layers block heat loss from the body, creating a blanket that helps insulate numbats from cold. As temperatures drop or cold winds pick up, numbats effectively reduce heat loss by erecting their pelts. Altogether, numbat pelts strike a balance between regulating how much heat gets in and how much is allowed out.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe insulating properties of piloerection offer ideas for designing movable hairlike systems, from microscopic to architectural, that can regulate heat in response to changing environmental conditions such as temperature, sunlight, winds, and humidity. These systems could be applied to fabrics, materials, and structures that efficiently capture heat and prevent heat loss and could lead to innovative fabrics or buildings that keep people safe and comfortable."}, {"Source": "mammalian cell's sodium channel", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "regulate fluid transport", "Function2": "generate currents", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/sodium-concentration-controls-fluid-transport/", "Strategy": "Sodium Concentration Controls Fluid Transport\n\nSodium channels in mammalian cells regulate fluid transport by cilia via changing fluid levels.\n\nCilia are tiny hair-like tufts on the surface of cells. They are found in many eukaryotes, from single-celled organisms to large animals. In humans they are found on the cells that line the airways, in the oviduct that carries the egg to the uterus, and in the ventricles (cavities) in the brain. Cilia beat in a coordinated rhythm in order to transport materials in one direction. In the airways, they clear contamination from the lungs with the help of mucus, in the oviduct they transport the egg, and in brain ventricles they generate currents in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nBeating cilia have two distinct phases: a power stroke that moves liquid forward, and a return stroke that prepares them for the next power stroke. Cilia rely on the surrounding liquid to sweep particles along with the flow. Without the appropriate quantity or consistency of liquid, the cilia cannot generate currents. As a result, transport can be regulated by controlling the liquid. In the oviduct, for example, liquid is only present during ovulation.\n\nIn order to alter the quantity and consistency of the liquid bathing the cilia, water must pass through the membranes of the cells that line the tissue. Water passes passively through the cell membrane depending on the concentration of salts on each side. Salt transport is tightly controlled by the cell and these ions cannot easily pass through the membrane. Water will pass through a semi-permeable membrane like that of the cell until the concentration of salts is the same on each side. In this way, if there is a higher concentration of salt on one side, water will move towards that side until the concentrations are balanced. Cells take advantage of this to regulate the amount of liquid that is bathing cilia. By actively pumping sodium ions into the space, they draw water out of the cell and bathe the cilia, promoting their action and allowing transport. To switch off cilia, cells pump sodium ions back inside the cell, drawing the water out of the space and preventing their action."}, {"Source": "forest tree", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "transport water", "Function2": "exchange nutrient", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/mycorrhizal-fungi-distribute-water-between-plants/", "Strategy": "Mycorrhizal Fungi Distribute\nWater Between Plants\n\nMycorrhizal network sustains diversity in a forest by transporting nutrients and water.\n\nMycorrhizal fungi, or mycorrhizae, live inside or attached to plant roots. The two types of organisms help each other to survive; that is, they are symbiotic. Fungi help plants to uptake soil nutrients in exchange for sugars produced by the plants. In forests, mycorrhizae form long strands called hyphae that run between trees, acting as connectors.  This giant underground transportation network is called the “common mycorrhizal network” or CMN.  The CMN uses chemical communication to exchange nutrients between trees on an “as-needed” basis.  Besides nutrients, the CMN also helps trees get water that their own roots would not be able to reach.\n\nWhen deep soils are moist and shallow soils are dry, trees pull water upward through their tap roots, which are deep in the soil, up to the shallow roots. Evaporation through the leaves and from the soil surface act like a drinking straw, pulling water through the plant and soil.  Mycorrhizal fungi can grab that water coming up from the deep tap root of one tree, send it along the highways of the CMN, and deposit it in the roots of a distant tree. With the mycorrhizae’s help, trees with roots too shallow to suck up water from deep soil can still get the water they need.  Whether trees are stressed from drought or are just a tiny seedling competing for water in a forest of giant adults, mycorrhizae help them survive.  Mycorrhizae can move water between trees of the same species, and between trees of different species.  By creating cooperation between species, the invisible underground network shapes the community of forest trees that we see above ground.\n\nWe do not yet know exactly how this microscopic highway in the soil works to move water around.  We do know that the active area of the fungus is the rhizomorph.  This is a special structure where nutrient and water exchange between the fungus and its host plants happens.  Both fungi and plants have proteins called aquaporins in their cell membranes. Aquaporins act like gates to allow water in or out of the cell. If both the rhizomorph aquaporins and the plant cell’s aquaporins are open at the same time, water can move between them.  There remains many mysteries to be uncovered about how symbiotic fungi and plants interact to distribute water in a forest.\n\nClimate change is presenting us with challenges related to water, food, and nutrient availability.  Some places may have shortages, while others have excess. The relationship between forest trees and the fungi that help them share resources based on need might help us solve these problems."}, {"Source": "nepenthes pitcher plant and treeshrew", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "provide nutrients", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/relationship-provides-nutrients/", "Strategy": "Relationship Provides Nutrients\n\nNepenthes pitcher plants and treeshrews maintain a mutually beneficial relationship by exchanging nutrients.\n\nIn Borneo’s tropical forests, a large, carnivorous pitcher plant, Nepenthes rajah, and a small mammal called a treeshrew have a great relationship. The pitcher plant lures the treeshrew in for some delicious nectar. While there, the mammal marks its feeding spot by dropping nitrogen-rich feces into the pitcher.\n\nPitcher plants have special leaves that form a tall jug, called a pitcher. They are best known for luring insects, especially ants, to the rounded rims of their pitchers. The rim of the pitcher has a slippery surface that causes insects to lose their grip and fall inside. Juices then digest the insects to release nutrients. However, Nepenthes rajah lives in a nutrient-poor area in the mountains that doesn’t have a lot of insects. So attracting, but not eating, the treeshrew is a good solution for getting additional nitrogen. At the same time, the treeshrew also gets fed. Nitrogen is important for photosynthesis and it helps the plant build leaves, roots, and stems.\n\nNepenthes rajah doesn’t have slippery surfaces because it’s not going to eat the treeshrew. Instead it has a special trick to get treeshrews do what the plant needs. Over the top of the pitcher is a lid, kind of like a toilet bowl lid (watch video). The lid angles upward over the top of the pitcher, and the nectar is on the edge of the lid. The distance from the nectar to the front of the pitcher’s opening is the exact same length as the treeshrew. This forces the animal to straddle the rim as it licks the nectar off the lid, and its feces drop directly into the pitcher.\n\nThis plant-mammal story can teach us the importance of meeting our own needs while also helping other people.

Over 100 species of these flowers exist, and most grow natively in North America. They’re late bloomers, ideal for sustaining late-season pollinators.\n\nBut they’re not just good for bees and butterflies. Throughout much of North America and especially in central regions, Goldenrod gall flies depend on some of these plants for their winter homes. In the spring, adult female gall flies lay eggs on newly sprouted stems. When an egg hatches, the larva chews its way into the stem. As a result, the stem develops a fat knot called a gall that becomes the larva’s shelter. It’s believed (though not known for sure), that the gall is a result of hormone-driven growth, stimulated by the larva’s saliva. The goldenrod, otherwise indifferent to its guest, continues to grow upward, eventually blooming and dying off in the fall. The larva stays enclosed within the gall throughout winter until warm temperatures stimulate it to transition to a pupa and then adult.\n\nIt might seem like wintering inside of a walnut-shaped abode would insulate the larva from the cold, but it doesn’t. Goldenrod gall fly larvae are “freeze-tolerant,” meaning they can freeze down to temperatures of -112°F (-80°C) during winter then thaw in the spring completely uninjured.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIf you’ve ever left a glass bottle full of water in the freezer, you learned the hard way that water expands when it freezes. Living cells are essentially membranes filled with water, and most would rupture (and die) if frozen. So how do gall flies survive?\n\nThe answer depends on how water moves in and out of cells. Water can diffuse across cellular membranes, driven to find an equilibrium between what’s inside the cell and what’s outside. Or water can pass through a class of proteins called aquaporins that work like doorways. These long snake-like proteins—with five loops connecting six helices that cross cell membranes—open pores, through which water can flow.\n\nAll living organisms, including humans, have aquaporin proteins, but they only impart freeze-tolerance to certain species of insects, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. Scientists at Miami University proved that these proteins are critical to freeze protection; when they inhibited the proteins’ function, the gall fly tissue could no longer survive extreme cold. As a result, the researchers concluded these aquaporin channels push water from cells before it can freeze, expand, and rupture cell membranes, which would cause the cells to burst and die.\n\nIn a later study, the same researchers verified this pushing effect, demonstrating that the aquaporin channels in gall flies allow water to flow across the membrane nine times faster than it would by diffusion. Furthermore, the number of these specialized channels increases in larval cells as the temperature cools. When the scientists compared protein abundance in October to that in December, they found the colder weather added almost 40% more aquaporins throughout the insect’s body. Perhaps most importantly, they measured the highest quantity in the brain—the organ that needs the most freeze-protection to ensure survival.\n\nTo augment the insect’s freeze protection, a related group of proteins called aquaglyceroporins open channels for glycerol to enter cells. Glycerol is similar to glycol—the main component in car engine antifreeze—and both are alcohols. Unlike a bottle of water, a bottle of vodka in the freezer is fine because alcohols tend to have very low freezing points. So while the aquaporin channels pump out water to protect membranes from rupturing, aquaglyceroporin channels pump in more “anti-freeze” to slow the rate and reduce the extent of freezing.\n\nThe Potential \n\nMuch of science fiction assumes that humans will one day be frozen in pods to endure eons spent in intergalactic travel without aging. While this may or may not be possible in the distant future, there are ways to improve how we freeze human biological material that could actually save many lives right here on Earth.\n\nWith the exception of plasma, most of the components in donated blood cannot be frozen. Although red blood cells can be frozen for emergency use, thawing them is expensive and requires trained staff and specialized equipment."}, {"Source": "baby bird's fecal sac", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "ease clearance of waste", "Function2": "maintain a clean nest", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fecal-sacs-help-keep-nests-clean/", "Strategy": "Fecal Sacs Help Keep Nests Clean\n\nFecal sacs produced by baby birds enable parents to maintain a clean nest by easing clearance of waste.\n\nBaby birds can stay in nests for many weeks before fledging (learning to fly).

Nestlings of some species excrete over the side of the nest, however for others this can attract predators and put the offspring at risk.

Seawater—and millions of microscopic animals—flow into the gape, which is big enough to engulf a yoga ball. The water flows out through the gills on the sides of the giant fish’s mouth. But the zooplankton are not so lucky.\n\nBrushlike structures on the sides of the gills interrupt their travels, diverting the tiny creatures toward the big fish’s stomach instead. And, amazingly, they do so without getting all clogged up. A marvelous arrangement of rib-like structures and spaces in between helps keep the microbes from getting stuck in the filters by creating swirls that keep them in place until they can be swallowed.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen a filter-feeding fish opens its mouth, microorganism-laden water flows in. Instead of moving directly through the gills, though, most of the water flows parallel to them. The gills’ main structure is a series of  hard, rib-like arches, which bear rows of smaller protruding spines called gill rakers. Together, these structures form a series of grooves with porous bottoms. The grooves are like alleys coming off the main path that water takes as it flows toward the back of the fish’s mouth. The water that interacts with the grooves gets redirected into them and exits the oral cavity through the porous gill rakers. If the main flow of the water were going directly through the gills, eventually the rakers would become clogged with particles. Since the mainstream flow is perpendicular to the gill alleys, it lifts and transports most of the filtered food particles toward the throat.\n\nEven this kind of crossflow filter can clog over time though. In some fish, like the basking shark and the paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), a second mechanism appears to prevent clogging further.\n\nIn these fish, each gill arch has a long protruding fin that creates especially deep grooves between them. As water flows across the edge of the gill arch, some of it is pulled down into the groove where it swirls up and is trapped by the flow above it. This vortex stays within the groove and helps prevent clogging by continuously forcing food particles to gather at the corners of the groove or stay suspended in the swirling water. This keeps particles out of the way of the gill raker filter where water exits. Additional structures, like the gill cover and muscle bands associated with the gills, appear to enable the fish to slightly modify the path of the vortex and capture food that collects in the grooves."}, {"Source": "eagle's beak", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "hold squirming prey", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/beak-holds-squirming-prey/", "Strategy": "Beak Holds Squirming Prey\n\nThe strong, hooked beaks of eagles hold squirming prey thanks to the sharp, pointed tip.\n\n“The beaks of birds of prey, such as eagles, are almost always very strong and hooked, with a sharp pointed tip for holding wriggling prey."}, {"Source": "marine viruses", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "enhance photosynthesis", "Function2": "increase cyanophage fitness", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/gene-transfers-enhance-photosynthesis/", "Strategy": "Gene Transfers Enhance Photosynthesis\n\nMarine viruses (called cyanophages) that infect cyanobacteria enhance photosynthesis in their hosts by displacing host photosynthesis genes with viral-encoded homologues.\n\n“Cyanophages are double-stranded DNA viruses belonging to three morphologically defined families: Podoviridae, Myoviridae, and Siphoviridae [3–5,9,10].

As agents of gene transfer, phages play a role in host evolution by supplying the host with new genetic material [11–15] and by displacing ‘host’ genes with viral-encoded homologues [16–18]…Because maximal cyanophage production is dependent on photosynthesis [31,33], and the host PsbA protein turns over rapidly [34] and declines during infection [31], expression of these phage-encoded genes likely enhances photosynthesis during infection, thus increasing cyanophage fitness.”"}, {"Source": "tree leaves", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "take in pollutants", "Function2": "break down pollutants", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-remove-pollution/", "Strategy": "Leaves Remove Pollution\n\nTree leaves take in pollutants from the atmosphere and use enzymes to break them down.\n\nWhen we drive our cars we burn gasoline this  produces air pollution such as volatile organic compounds, or VOC’s.

These tiny particles can affect how sunlight gets through the atmosphere, which negatively impacts the climate.  Aerosols can also cause serious respiratory problems such as asthma and emphysema when people breathe them in. Some oVOC’s combine with other chemicals in the air to create different pollutants, such as ozone. When ozone is in the air at ground level, it can be a harmful toxin.

Often, bacteria have impressive abilities that are rare in other creatures. Some bacteria, for instance, can actually eat fossil fuels, like petroleum (used to make gasoline) or coal. This ability enables bacteria to survive in places that many other species can’t.\n\nLike all species, including humans, bacteria need water to help them break down or digest food. But bacteria can also break down fossil fuels, which are oils, and oil and water don’t mix together. So how do these bacteria manage to use water to help them digest oils anyway?\n\nNormally, water molecules like to stick together, which results in oil being pushed out, keeping the two liquids separated. This happens because the structure of a water molecule gives it a negative charge on one side and a positive charge on the other. (This is what is known as a “polar” molecule.) That means one water molecule’s positive end likes to stick to the neighboring molecule’s negative end, making water cling together like a pack of weak magnets. As a result, oil (a non-polar molecule) gets pushed out and stays separated from water.\n\nSome bacteria make special molecules called surfactants that help them pry water molecules apart, so that water can mix more easily with other substances. These special molecules have one end that is attracted to water (also known as hydrophilic, or “water-loving”) and one end that is repelled by water (hydrophobic, or “water-fearing”). So, while one end of a surfactant molecule attaches to a water molecule, the other end of the surfactant pushes other water molecules away. The result is that water no longer sticks together as well. This enables other substances like oil to fill in the spaces and come in closer contact with water. Two liquids which previously didn’t mix all of a sudden can mix together. Once mixed together in water, bacteria can begin to digest or break down the oil  into simpler molecules and atoms, like hydrogen and carbon (the component parts of oils).\n\nThe actinobacteria are a large class of bacteria that includes 54 known families. They are able to make many different kinds of surfactants. Actinobacteria produce surfactant molecules having different shapes, sizes, and chemical behaviors. All of these different qualities make these surfactants behave slightly differently and enable the actinobacteria to digest many different oil-based food sources. Molecular methods of changing how oil is distributed can help people clean up wildlife and the environment in the case of oil spills. Bacterial surfactants were used to help clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill, for example, and have been shown to clean shorelines contaminated with spilled oil.

Species like the elephant seal, penguin, reindeer, camel, kangaroo rat have a particularly effective so-called temporal counter-current exchange mechanism in their nasal passages that minimizes the amount of water lost from the respiratory system. The nasal turbinates are important structural and functional components of this mechanism. This is a series of boney, shelf-like structures in the nasal passageway covered with a well-vascularized layer of moist tissue and mucus. Inhaled air passing over this surface is warmed and moistened, and the surfaces cool due to evaporation. When the animal exhales, warm, water-saturated air from the lungs passes across the cooled nasal turbinate surfaces and water condenses out of it, staying within the nasal passages rather than being lost to the outside air.

The key features of the more elaborate nasal turbinates are their very large surface area and the short distance from that surface to the middle of the airstream.\n\nDesigns of nasal turbinates in marine mammals like the elephant seal may offer inspiration for the design of more effective human-constructed water and heat recapturing systems."}, {"Source": "plant's pigment molecule", "Application": "solar cells", "Function1": "absorb solar energy", "Function2": "transfer solar energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pigment-molecules-absorb-and-transfer-solar-energy/", "Strategy": "Pigment Molecules Absorb\nand Transfer Solar Energy\n\nPigment molecules in plants absorb and transfer solar energy using a special arrangement that funnels light toward a reaction center.\n\nThe process of photosynthesis in plants involves a series of steps and reactions that use solar energy, water, and carbon dioxide to produce organic compounds. One of the first steps in this complex process depends on chlorophyll and other pigment molecules.\n\nChlorophyll is the green pigment molecule that makes plants appear green. In photosynthetic plant cells, chlorophyll molecules are embedded in stacked membranes (thylakoids) contained in special membrane-bound organelles called chloroplasts. The chlorophyll molecules are arranged in discrete units called photosystems, each of which contains hundreds of pigment molecules (chlorophyll plus others) arranged into an “antenna complex” surrounding a reaction center.\n\nWhen light hits a pigment molecule in the antenna complex, the light energy “excites” the molecule, causing its electrons to jump to a higher level of energy. This excited state is temporary, and when the electrons fall back to a lower energy level, energy is released. This released energy can be transferred to a neighboring pigment molecule and so on, creating a chain of excited pigment molecules that ultimately deliver the energy to the photosystem’s reaction center. The reaction center contains special chlorophyll molecules that have a specific response to absorbing energy: rather than transferring only energy, the chlorophyll’s resulting high-energy electrons are transferred themselves to an electron-acceptor molecule, which begins the flow of electrons that plays a key role in the rest of photosynthesis.\n\nDye-sensitized solar cells are an example of a plant-inspired technology, where light sensitive dye molecules (commonly containing the metal ruthenium, but organic dyes are being developed, as well) are used to absorb and transfer solar energy.

When it rains, water can collect on leaves and block stomata, stalling photosynthesis. In order to prevent this, most plants have a waxy coating that ensures water runs off their leaves quickly. In shady and humid places such as those where bamboo most commonly grows, water condenses easily, and simple waxy surfaces might not be enough to protect them.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe young leaves of the fish-pole bamboo, Phyllostachys aurea, have strongly hydrophobic margins that cause water to form beads that roll easily across their surfaces. This “super-hydrophobicity” comes from epicuticular wax, which repels water chemically. The wax forms into countless needle-like plates that trap air between the surface of the leaf and the water droplet and minimize the contact area between the water and the surface, increasing repellency and preventing the drop from spreading. The mechanism is very similar to that used by the sacred lotus and, like the lotus, it makes the leaves self-cleaning, as rolling water droplets pick up and remove contaminating particles.\n\nThe bamboo leaves are particularly effective at directing water away because they have a central channel that is hydrophilic. The wax that coats the leaf surfaces in the channel is flat and has a slightly different chemical composition that makes water spread across the surface instead of forming beads. The concave shape of the leaf guides droplets from the margin to the central channel, where they collect and form a continuous flow down the leaf to its tip, where water drips harmlessly away.\n\nThe Potential\n\nTexture-based approaches to water repellency (i.e., Lotus Effect) are highly promising, but may not be as effective for applications in particularly humid conditions. The fish-pole bamboo’s strategy for hydrophobicity adds an additional dimension to texture-based water repellency that could prove helpful in the wettest environments.\n\nApplications include replacing chemical approaches and improving texture-based approaches to liquid repellency on clothing, upholstery, vehicles, buildings, solar panels, the inside of bottles, and other technological surfaces where repellency and dryness are valuable."}, {"Source": "yeti crab's fiber-covered claws", "Application": "sustainable agriculture", "Function1": "produce food", "Function2": "convert methane to food", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fibers-promote-growth-of-edible-bacteria/", "Strategy": "Fibers Promote Growth of Edible Bacteria\n\nThe yeti crab uses its fiber-covered claws to farm methane-fixing bacteria for food.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHarnessing the power of the sun to produce energy is at the root of most food chains on Earth. Through photosynthesis, plants combine light energy with water and carbon dioxide and convert it to sugars and oxygen, creating the lush, green world around us. But in the deep sea, far from the sunshine at the surface, organisms have evolved to rely on different sources of energy.\n\nTwo of these sources, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, have been found to support communities of creatures that are found nowhere else on Earth. One of these, the appropriately named yeti crab (Kiwa puravida), with its large, furry-looking claws, appears to farm the bacteria that it feeds on in a clever example of symbiosis.\n\nWith their claws waving rhythmically through methane seeps,yeti crabs cultivate a home grown source of food for themselves.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nCold seeps occur where gases diffuse through shallow openings in the shifting seafloor. One of these gases is methane, which some bacteria can harness to produce food through chemosynthesis.\n\nUsing a deep sea submersible, scientists discovered the yeti crab at a methane seep off the coast of Costa Rica. They watched as the crabs waved their claws back and forth over the methane seep, and seemed to push away, rather than prey on, small shrimp around them. Intrigued, the researchers collected a few crabs and brought them back to the lab to investigate further.\n\nBy examining stomach contents and chemicals in their tissue, the researchers confirmed that the crabs feed primarily on these bacteria, though they may also supplement this diet with other organisms swept from the seafloor.\n\nUsing behavioral and physical adaptations, the crabs facilitate the growth and harvesting of these bacteria. Specialized hairs, called setae, are found along the bodies of crabs, taking various forms depending on their specific location. Unlike with other crab species, the claws of yeti crabs are densely covered in specialized bristle-like setae. These provide a base for the methane-fixing bacteria to grow on. The claw-waving action appears to help the bacteria grow by increasing access to nutrients from the methane seep and oxygen in the water column. The crabs can then scrape the bacteria off their claws using other more comb-like setae near their mouths.\n\nAt five times actual speed, the motions of the yeti crabharvesting bacteria become more instantly recognizable.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe yeti crab’s adaptation to a harsh and resource-limited environment offers a model for sustainable human systems. With behavioral and physical adaptations, the crab is able to harness a plentiful resource to produce food, creating abundance in a landscape otherwise void of the nutrients needed to support life.\n\nMethane gas doesn’t just occur naturally at deep sea vents––it is also a common by-product of human activities, including landfill creation and livestock farming. Once released into the atmosphere, it acts as a potent greenhouse gas 84 times stronger than carbon dioxide. This is why most of the methane produced at human-made facilities is burned, or “flared,” which converts it to carbon dioxide, although it is sometimes captured and used to generate electricity.\n\nHarnessing this methane gas has the potential to use a waste by-product for sustainable agriculture. Research is already underway in this field, with efforts to produce high-protein food by drying methane-fixing bacteria to produce feed pellets. These pellets could then be fed to livestock or farmed fish, with a greatly reduced water and land footprint compared to more conventional sources of feed like soy or wheat.\n\nThe key to the sustainability of this method is to use methane that is being released from other human sources, which focuses on reducing waste at the source. With its clever adaptations, the yeti crab could provide clues for more effective ways to harness an under-utilized resource to help address pressing issues of food security, land use change, and water scarcity around the world."}, {"Source": "mangrove leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "regulate salt concentration", "Function2": "accumulate excess salt", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-accumulate-excess-salt/", "Strategy": "Leaves Accumulate Excess Salt\n\nThe leaves of some mangroves regulate salt concentrations by accumulating excess salt in special compartments within their cells.\n\nMangroves are small shrubs or trees that grow in the presence of salt water along coastlines. Constant exposure to salt water can lead to an imbalance of ions within the plant’s cells, which can have toxic effects on enzymes or interfere with water absorption. To address this, the cells control their internal environment by keeping sodium, potassium, and chloride ions at a stable concentration. Mangroves can survive in especially salty environmental conditions using various strategies that regulate how much salt ends up in their tissues. For example, certain species exclude salt by preventing salt from entering the roots, some excrete excess salt through glands in their leaves, while others accumulate ions in special compartments in their leaves.\n\nIon sequestration is one mechanism used to relieve the negative effects of salt stress.  Mangroves reduce the amount of sodium ions, for example, in the cell’s main compartment by moving excess sodium into a special membrane-enclosed compartment called a vacuole. By sequestering excess ions into vacuoles, the cell’s main compartment maintains a balanced concentration of ions.\n\nThese ions are transported into the vacuole with special proteins embedded in the vacuole membrane, such as proton (hydrogen ion) pumps and sodium-hydrogen antiporters. These membrane proteins work together to build a high concentration of sodium ions in the vacuole. Because the ions are moving from an area of low concentration to a high concentration (against its concentration gradient), this requires energy. First, proton pumps use the energy-rich molecule, ATP, to move protons into the vacuole and establish a proton gradient. This proton gradient functions as stored energy. With the help of the sodium-hydrogen antiporters, the protons flow down their concentration gradient out of the vacuole and into the cell’s main compartment. This releases the stored energy, which is then used to transport sodium ions into the vacuole. The sodium ion concentration in the vacuole builds and the ions remain there until the leaf matures and falls."}, {"Source": "forest tree", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "transport water and nutrient", "Function2": "share sugar", "Function3": "send chemical signal", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fungal-network-distributes-resources/", "Strategy": "Underground Network Distributes Resources\n\nMycorrhizal network sustains diversity in a forest by transporting nutrients and water.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a Douglas-fir and pine forest in North America there are trees of all ages, ranging from tiny seedlings to giants that are hundreds of years old. Hidden in the soil is a vast network made up of millions of miles of thin threads called mycelium. Most of the mycelium spread throughout this forest are mycorrhizal fungi. These are fungi that live in a mutualistic partnership with trees and other plants.\n\nThe mycelium acts like an internet network but instead of moving electronic information around, they transport water and chemicals to keep the trees alive and communicating with each other. This network has been called the “Wood Wide Web”.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nOn the internet, nodes are individual computers and the network moves information among them. Hubs are places that connect lots of nodes together and have a lot of information traveling through them, such as Google. The nodes of the Wood Wide Web are all the individual trees in the forest. The oldest trees, which are often also the tallest and largest, are the ‘hubs’ because they have the most connections running through them.\n\nMycelia form the connections between all the nodes in the Wood Wide Web. The mycelia wrap around the fine roots of the hub tree and other vegetation, snuggling so close that water, nutrients, and other chemicals can move between the cells of the roots and fungi. A hub tree has more access to sunlight than smaller trees because of its size. Sometimes that results in it producing too much sugar through photosynthesis. When this happens, it sends the sugar out through the mycelium network to be used by its own seedlings and even other species of trees. The fungi take some of the sugar as it passes between trees and use it for themselves.\n\nWater is also shared among the fungi and plants in the network. The water and nutrients increase seedling growth and help other trees survive. At another time, if the hub tree is stressed and needs water or nutrients, the mycelium and other trees can send them back to the hub tree.\n\nBut this isn’t just about one hub tree. It’s about a hub tree connected to a seedling connected to a sapling, connected to another hub tree, and so on. Researchers at a study site in Canada discovered that one tree was connected to 47 others through this network. Sixty percent of the tree species in the world are associated with these mycorrhizal fungi. Most trees form symbioses with a wide variety of fungal species (there are more than 5000 of them) and each species of fungus can have relationships with a wide variety of trees.\n\nBesides sharing nutrients and water, the network also sends warnings. If a tree is attacked by a bark beetle, it sends out a chemical signal, called a defense signal. The mycelium passes this signal along to other nearby trees. When they get the signal, they reinforce their chemical defenses, which makes it easier for them to fight off an attack when it comes.\n \n"}, {"Source": "pitcher plant's internal walls", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent insects from escaping", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/walls-keep-insect-feet-from-sticking/", "Strategy": "Walls Keep Insect Feet From Sticking\n\nThe internal walls of pitcher plants prevent insects from escaping by clogging their feet with a flaky, waxy substance and being rough.\n\n“The plant lures animals, from insects to amphibians to rats and even birds, into a modified leaf that forms a bowl.

It commonly grows in stands, sometimes interspersed with other tree species such as black spruce. But it’s the connections they make with others of their own species that give them an advantage when facing such harsh environments.\n\nOnce a graft forms, trees can share resources through the connected roots, often among multiple individuals connected by the unseen web beneath the soil.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen one jack pine tree’s roots run into the roots of another, they may press into each other. The roots begin to add cells along the pressure points until the bark between them breaks through.\n\nAs the tissues from the two plants contact each other directly, the individual cells start to stick together. The surrounding tissue deposits sugar molecules, creating an even stronger bond. New cells develop and eventually form xylem and phloem, the woody vessels that carry food, nutrients and water.\n\nThe result is a shared root structure that often contains root material from both trees. Once a graft forms, trees can share resources through the connected roots, often among multiple individuals connected by the unseen web beneath the soil.\n\nAlthough grafts initially reduce individual tree growth, in the long run they appear to benefit the stand as a whole. The shared roots allow trees growing in more favorable conditions within the stand to give weaker, disadvantaged trees a boost. They allow stumps to stay alive, helping to crowd out potentially competing tree species. And because up to 70% of the stand may form grafts, they provide added stability against strong winds.\n\nThe Potential\n\nMaking deep connections between individuals facing different challenges can allow for the effective flow of resources and information in human and technological settings as well as in underground root systems.

When an unsuspecting prey brushes up against two touch-sensitive hairs on the inside of the trap-shaped leaves, the trap snaps shut, ensnaring the prey for later digestion.\n\nThe touch-sensitive hairs, known as trigger hairs, signal trap closure using sodium-activated action potentials (APs). An action potential is a way for cells to send information to one another in the form of an electrical signal. It occurs when positively charged ions, such as sodium, enter a cell and cause the electrical environment of the cell membrane to change until it reaches a certain threshold. After it reaches this threshold the cell “fires,” sending the electrical signal to another cell to activate a response.\n\nIn the case of the Venus flytrap, the two trigger hairs send a signal to the leaves to snap shut. Physical stimulation of one hair releases sodium ions into the hair cell, triggering the first action potential. Stimulating a second hair will release more sodium ions, triggering a second AP.  Once two APs are elicited within 15-20 seconds of each other, these electrical signals stimulate motor cells in the leaves to snap the trap shut. This signal is incredibly fast, and the trap snaps shut within 100 ms of the triggering of the second hair.\n\nOnce the prey is captured it struggles to escape, continuously brushing more trigger hairs that fire more action potentials. These signals are sent to glands that line the leaves, which release enzymes to digest the prey.

Cribellate spiders use a comb-like structure on their legs to puff up their silk into a ball-like tangle.

Instead, once it condenses the water quickly starts to move, migrating from the thin threads towards the tangles.

The curved shape of the tangles also helps channel water. The result is that water collects and gets stored in the tangles, creating larger and larger water drops.

The mounds generally resemble chimneys, but different species ventilate their mounds in different ways. Some species may create ‘open’ mounds with chimneys or vent holes, while others build ‘closed’ mounds that lack large openings but have porous walls. Inside both of these mounds, worker termites can dig a complex array of tunnels of various sizes. The termites themselves live in nests below ground in colonies that can contain up to a million individuals.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe most recent published research on termite mounds suggests that they function much like mammalian lungs and act as accessory organs for gas exchange in the underground nests. It was previously thought that termite mounds functioned to continuously maintain the nest’s internal temperature within a narrow range in the face of extreme outside temperature fluctuations, but research on mound-building termites like Macrotermes michaelseni, which construct closed mounds, is expanding our understanding of how these mounds function. During the day, changes in internal nest temperature are less extreme than changes in outside temperature, but over the course of a year, nest temperature does vary and closely follows the temperature of the surrounding soil. The soil has a large thermal capacity, meaning it can absorb or lose large amounts of heat energy before experiencing any changes in temperature. In a way, the soil around the termite nest acts as a “buffer” against daily changes in outside temperature.\n\nResearchers are actively studying mounds to understand precisely how mound structure facilitates gas exchange in the underground colony. It appears that the main mechanism is through internal air currents driven by solar heat. As outside temperatures change throughout the day and the sun strikes different surfaces on the mound, temperature gradients develop between the mound periphery and center. These temperature gradients create currents of rising and falling air inside the mound. The direction of these currents varies as temperature gradients change throughout the day. Wind energy from unsteady airflows outside the mound may also play a secondary role in ventilation. The internal airflows likely promote mixing between air in the mound and air in the nest, ultimately facilitating gas exchange in the nest.\n\nThe Potential In the United States, homes and buildings account for about 40% of our total electricity consumption, and about one-third of that is from heating and ventilation systems. The growing understanding of macrotermite mound structure and function could inspire energy-saving climate control systems, which could substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n"}, {"Source": "giant water lily's leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "optimize photosynthesis", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-optimize-photosynthesis/", "Strategy": "Leaves Optimize Photosynthesis\n\nThe leaf of a giant water lily optimizes photosynthesis due to its structure and extreme surface area.\n\n“In still or slowly-moving waters there is one easy way to collect [light]: a plant can float its leaves upon the surface.

Found in every ocean on the planet except the Arctic, it grows as long as three school buses lined up end to end and can weigh more than nine school buses full of kids. What does a behemoth this big eat? Ironically, almost exclusively one of the ocean’s smallest animals—crustaceans known as krill, which swim about in large schools.\n\nHow the blue whale eats krill is as remarkable as the fact that it does so. Opening its massive mouth, it engulfs a school of krill along with enough seawater to double its weight. Then, it uses baleen, a bristly structure attached to its top jaw, as a sieve to catch the krill as it forces the water back out into the ocean.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe blue whale’s baleen is composed of keratin, the same type of material that makes up fingernails and hair. About 350 plates of this material hang down from each side of its upper jaw where the whale’s top teeth would be (if it had teeth).\n\nThe plates grow out of the jaw parallel to each other and perpendicular to the jaw, lined up like slats of a vertical window blind. Each plate is made up of a main plate and smaller plates, forming a triangular profile. The plates contain tubules that separate to form a frayed edge on the tongue side and at the bottom made up of densely packed bristles 2 millimeters or smaller in diameter.\n\nAfter taking in krill and water together, the whale partly closes its mouth so that the water has to go through the baleen as it moves back out into the ocean. The baleen plates and fringes are able to trap krill down to a size of about half a millimeter.\n\nThe blue whale is one of 14 whale species that use baleen as part of their foraging strategy. The length of the baleen plates and the nature of the bristles varies from one to another depending on the whale’s foraging style and the size of prey they prefer.\n\nA recent study suggests that at least one whale species, the bowhead (Balaena mysticetus), uses the baleen to direct food to the back of its throat rather than as an actual filter, which helps it avoid clogging the mechanism with bits of prey. The exact movement of water and krill within a blue whale’s mouth—and how it keeps from clogging and/or cleans its baleen—appears to remain a mystery for now.\n\nThe Potential A blue whale’s approach to separate tiny particles from large amounts of water can find numerous applications in solving human needs. Baleen-like screens could be used to filter particles from wastewater as part of a conventional treatment process. They could provide a first level of cleansing for drinking water taken from lakes and streams. They could be used to produce beverages such as beer, wine, and apple cider that include non-liquid materials during part of their processing. They might prove useful in removing microplastic pollutants from soil, water, and other contaminated materials.

It then approaches that object and uses its chin to explore more closely. If it’s a prey item, the fish may use its chin to dig into the mud. If the object is larger or unknown, the fish can swim all around the object and “scan” it with its chin and the other electroreceptors on its body.\n\nThe vast number of electroreceptors enables the fish to determine not only the shape of an object, but its volume, size, material, and maybe even which direction it’s facing. The elephantnose fish can use the images formed through electrolocation to navigate its environment, avoiding hitting objects as it swims while hunting smaller prey. These images aren’t perfectly clear, but are like someone near-sighted seeing a blurry world when they don’t have their glasses on. This doesn’t affect the fish too much, as basic shapes and patterns are all that are needed to survive and thrive.\n \n"}, {"Source": "salvinia water fern's leaf structure", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "retain air layer", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaf-structure-retains-air-layer-underwater/", "Strategy": "Leaf Structure Retains Air Layer Underwater\n\nThe leaf structure of the Salvinia water fern retains a layer of air when submerged in water due to water-resistant hairs that possess water-attracting tips.\n\nThe floating water fern, Salvinia, is a unique plant in that it retains pockets of dry air when fully submerged in water. This capability, which provides the plant with buoyancy, is owed to the surface structure of its leaves.\n\nThe water fern’s leaves are covered in tiny hairs grouped to look like miniature wire cooking whisks. Each hair is coated in hydrophobic (water-repelling) wax crystals from its base not quite to its tip.

These water molecules are pinned on the tips of the hairs, thus reducing the impact of instabilities in the surrounding water. By having a large surface of hydrophilic hairs, water forms a boundary that aids in reducing drag as the plant moves in the fluid environment by creating less water-plant interaction between hairs.\n\nThis combination of hydrophilic patches on hydrophobic surfaces is known as the “Salvinia Effect.” It is responsible for retaining an air layer underwater on the fern’s leaves for up to several weeks."}, {"Source": "desert hottentot bread plant's corky tuber", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "store water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/corky-tuber-stores-water/", "Strategy": "Corky Tuber Stores Water\n\nThe desert Hottentot bread plant stores vast amounts of water in a large, underground corky tuber.\n\n“Swollen roots are used by a great number of plants as storage tanks.

In an average rainfall episode, up to two thirds of rainwater can evaporate before penetrating the soil. Because of this, most desert plants have shallow roots that collect the remaining surface water before it evaporates further.\n\nThe desert rhubarb sets itself apart by having a sophisticated water collection system that transports and absorbs water deep in the ground. First, rain water collects on the surface of the rhubarb’s leaves. The rhubarb has one to four meter long leaves with a series of successively wider, hydrophobic (meaning “water-fearing”) grooves embedded into its sides. In a sleek system, the grooves funnel rain water down the leaf similar to a system of rivers and creeks down a mountain.\n\nNext, the collected rainwater pools on the soil at the base of the plant. This small area of soil becomes saturated, allowing water to seep deeper into the soil. In an average rainfall, water penetrates desert soil between one to three centimeters. Pooling around the rhubarb, however, helps water to penetrate over ten centimeters into the ground. This is a comparatively high volume of water collected. In addition, the deeper the water penetrates the soil, the less exposed it is to the sun’s heat, and the less it will evaporate.\n\nLastly, the water is absorbed. The rhubarb has a single, long root that extends down into the desert ground. Compared to the thin shallow root system of its neighbors, the rhubarb root absorbs up to three times as much rainwater.

How can they harvest the solar energy they need without also overheating and drying out?\n\nThe window plant (Fenestraria aurantiaca), which grows in the Namib Desert in southern Africa, has an intriguing solution.

There, those cells use photosynthesis to turn the light into energy the plant can use.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe window plant’s strategy for vertically transmitting light is used to some extent to bring light into buildings through tubes running from the roof to the occupied space. This technology could be dramatically enhanced by taking the window plant’s next step of using water or another substance that bends light to direct beams in the direction they’re needed most.\n\nIt also can provide inspiration for designing solar photovoltaic installations that are less susceptible to overheating and better able to focus light on electricity-generating structures.

Within this family, 98% of the species possess hygrochastic capsules with an ombrohydrochoric seed dispersal mechanism which in part are also responsible for the remarkable speciation burst and radiation. The highly complex capsules open when wet, and the seeds are expelled by a ‘jet action’ with the kinetic energy of raindrops. The halves of the covering membranes of a locule form a nozzle near the centre of the capsule which serves as a jet.

When the humidity increases, the hydrophilic crystalline substance dissolves and is swallowed back into the body of the tick.

As life moved from liquid to land, one of its biggest challenges became retaining water. The very top layer of skin, known as the “stratum corneum,” plays a big job in keeping its owner from drying out.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIn humans, the stratum corneum consists of 15-20 layers of cells called corneocytes embedded in a flexible fatty matrix. Corneocytes are made up of a skeleton made of keratin (a protein) and natural moisturizing factor (NMF), which in turn is composed of water and different small molecules.\n\nWhen the corneocytes encounter water they absorb it. In the outermost layer of the stratum corneum,  the keratin is packed together tightly, so it doesn’t bind water well, but the NMF is able to hang onto water molecules. In the middle layer,  the keratin is unfolded. This provides room for water molecules. Not only that, but as water molecules move in, they elbow the keratin apart, making even more room for more water molecules and giving the skin a sponge like capacity to absorb moisture.\n\nThis combination allows the corneocytes to expand but stay mobile, embedded in the fats. As a result,  the skin remains soft and pliable while also regulating the ability of water to flow through the stratum corneum into or out of the body.

However, high payloads are not shown to result in more efficient transport. Instead, foragers generally carry loads well below their maximum potential. Load size is influenced by two factors: a more manageable workload for processor ants, and the speed of other foragers.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen foragers return to the colony, they pass their loads to the processor ants. Processors collect the material and distribute it among the colony. There are more foragers than processors. If every forager brought large of loads to the colony, the processors would be overwhelmed by the volume of leaves coming into the colony and fall behind. As a result, materials would not be distributed throughout the colony in a timely manner.\n\nThe Potential\n\nForagers also carry small loads in order to maintain a consistent speed in relation to other ants. Foragers travel to and from their colony in a single file line, also referred to as unilateral transport. This is because foraging ants travel by following the chemical scent of the forager directly in front of them. It’s as if ants travel down a one lane highway, where passing is illegal. Because smaller loads mean faster foraging and bigger loads mean slower foraging, if one ant chooses to take a larger than average load it will slow down the entire group. This can have a serious effect on the colony as a whole.\n"}, {"Source": "bottlenose dolphin's blubber", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "absorb heat", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/blubber-absorbs-heat/", "Strategy": "Blubber Absorbs Heat\n\nThe blubber of the bottlenose dolphin absorbs heat by acting as a phase change material\n\n“There is substantial evidence to support the classification of the integument, and specifically the blubber layer [of the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin], as a phase change material. First, many of the fatty acids found in blubber are classified as phase change materials and have melting points in the range of mammalian body temperatures (Sari, 2003; Sari and Kaygusuz, 2001; Sari et al., 2003; Suppes et al., 2003). Suppes et al. (2003) classified palmitic (C16:0), steric (18:0), oleic (C18:1), linoleic (C18:2), linolenic (C18:3) and arachidic (C20:0) fatty acids as excellent phase change materials. All of these fatty acids have been identified in cetacean blubber (Koopman et al., 1996). Mixtures of these fatty acids yield phase change materials with melting points between 29° and 38°C (Suppes et al., 2003), which include the range of mammalian body temperatures. Second, these fatty acids also satisfy the requirement that the material has a relatively large latent heat plateau, with latent heat values generally greater than 180·J·g–1 (Suppes et al., 2003). Third, their stratification in blubber may be prevented by their containment in adipocytes as well as the highly structured nature of adipocytes in the blubber tissue. Finally, cetaceans are known to have fine vascular control to their appendages and to the periphery of their body (Elsner et al., 1974; Kvadsheim and Folkow, 1997; Ling, 1974; Meagher et al., 2002; Pabst et al., 1999b; Scholander and Schevill, 1955). Intermittent heat loads could be applied to the blubber through shunting of warm blood to the blubber layer, followed by periods of vasoconstriction. Future studies are needed to fully characterize blubber’s potential phase change properties as well as investigate the possible functions that may be associated with such a property.” "}, {"Source": "trees along rivers", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "retain carbon", "Function2": "slow down water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/storage-of-organic-matter-plugs-carbon-leaks/", "Strategy": "Storage of Organic Matter Plugs Carbon Leaks\n\nTrees along rivers help retain carbon in an ecosystem by adding organic debris and slowing down water.\n\n“Although humans have usurped the power that trees once wielded over major rivers, woody debris still plays a key role in the structure of headwater creeks and streams. Just as important, trees and their litter supply much–sometimes all–of the organic matter that supports the food chain in these waters, from insects to salmon and trout. Without fallen trees and log or beaver dams to slow the current, this litter of leaves, needles, twigs, cones, branches, and bark would be of little food value. Microorganisms from fungi to insects would not have time to decompose the material were it not allowed to accumulate behind obstacles…How long the debris dams that support this food web endure depends in part on the types of trees that line the stream. Hardwood logs will rot in just a few years. Conifers, because they contain more lignins (complex polymers that make wood rigid) and other hard-to-decompose compounds, may last a century and provide great stability for the stream community.” \n\nAlso, this abstract from Bilby and Likens: “Removal of all organic debris dams from a 175-m stretch of second-order stream at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire led to a dramatic increase in the export of organic carbon from this ecosystem. Output of dissolved organic carbon (<0.50 μm) increased 18%. Fine particulate organic carbon (0.50 μm-1 mm) export increased 632% and coarse particulate organic matter (>1 mm) export increased 138%. Measurement of the standing stock of coarse particulate organic matter on streambeds of the Hubbard Brook Valley revealed that organic debris dams were very important in accumulating this material. In first-order streams, debris dams contain nearly 75% of the standing stock of organic matter. The proportion of organic matter held by dams drops to 58% in second-order streams and to 20% in third-order streams. Organic debris dams, therefore, are extremely important components of the small stream ecosystem. They retain organic matter within the system, thereby allowing it to be processed into finer size fractions in headwater tributaries rather than transported downstream in a coarse particulate form.”"}, {"Source": "dromedary camel's nasal surfaces", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "cool exhaled air", "Function2": "extract water vapor", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nasal-surfaces-remove-water-vapor/", "Strategy": "Nasal Surfaces Remove Water Vapor\n\nThe nasal surfaces of camels help conserve water by using hygroscopic properties to remove water from air during exhalation.\n\nWhen the dromedary camel gets dehydrated in its hot and arid environment, its nasal surfaces help the animal conserve water using two mechanisms: by cooling exhaled air during the night, and by extracting water vapor from exhaled air.\n\nDuring the nighttime, outside temperatures are typically lower than the camel’s core body temperature. When the camel inhales, the cool outside air passes through the nasal passages where heat is exchanged: the nasal surfaces are cooled while the incoming air is warmed. Inside the camel’s lungs, air is at body temperature and fully saturated with water (100% relative humidity). When the camel exhales, the warm air inside the lungs passes over the cool nasal surfaces and exchanges heat again. This time, the air is cooled as it’s exhaled, and as it cools, water vapor in the outgoing air condenses onto the nasal surfaces as liquid water. The exhaled air is still at 100% relative humidity, but the lower temperature means that more water exists in liquid form than in vapor form (read an explanation of why this occurs here). Several mammals and birds use this mechanism of cooling exhaled air to conserve water and heat.\n\nBut the dromedary camel uses a second mechanism to save even more water: it extracts water vapor from the exhaled air, desaturating it down to 75-80% relative humidity. The dry nasal surfaces of a dehydrated camel are hygroscopic, meaning they can absorb and hold onto water molecules from the surrounding air. The hygroscopic nasal surfaces absorb water from the exhaled air and give off water to inhaled air.\n\nOne reason these water recovery mechanisms work so effectively in the dromedary camel is the large total surface area of the turbinate structures in its nasal passages. Turbinates are spongy nasal bones, and the camel’s turbinates are highly scrolled, providing narrow air passageways and a large surface area for water and heat exchange. Measurements suggest that camels have more than 1000 cm2 of nasal surface area, whereas the human nasal cavity may have a total surface area of only 160-180 cm2.\n\nWhy does the camel use the first mechanism and exhale cooled air only during the night? During the hot daytime, preventing the brain from overheating is prioritized over conserving water. Exhaling air that’s warm and saturated with water vapor enables the camel to dump excess heat from its body, but this comes at the expense of saving water."}, {"Source": "firefly's abdomen", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "transmit light efficiently", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nanostructures-help-transmit-light/", "Strategy": "Nanostructures Help Transmit Light\n\nNanostructures on the cuticle of the firefly's abdomen help transmit bioluminescent light efficiently because they perfectly match the wavelength of light being emitted.\n\nA male firefly attracts mates by emanating bioluminescent light from a lantern on its abdomen.

That’s why damage to our veins and arteries can be so devastating, and why cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death for humans worldwide.\n\nMuch of the problem stems from the build-up over time of hardening agents in the walls of arteries. Healthy arterial walls require a constant supply of oxygen––artery walls receiving less oxygen are more likely to harden. Fortunately, our arteries have surprising and subtle adaptations to help us remain healthy throughout our lifetimes.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAs our arteries carry oxygen-enriched blood from our lungs to the rest of our bodies, they often curve and twist in three-dimensional space like a corkscrew. Why don’t they just travel in seemingly efficient straight lines?\n\nIt turns out that those helical twists create helical flow patterns within vessels that better mix oxygen in the bloodstream. They also cause our flowing blood to exert more force against the artery walls. This force, called wall shear stress, directly affects the amount of oxygen absorbed by the walls. It’s similar to eating a tasty candy: if you roll it around in your mouth, your taste buds have a chance to experience the flavor, but if you swallow it straight down, you hardly taste a thing,\n\nSimilarly, straighter arteries have less opportunity to interact with the oxygen flowing through them. That puts them at greater risk of hardening than helical ones. Thus, the seemingly inefficient twists in our veins and arteries are ultimately critical for maintaining the health and functioning of the system as a whole.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe natural helical geometries of our vascular system can serve as an inspiration in the design of grafts, shunts, and stents used in procedures such as dialysis and bypass surgery. Helical stents modeled on the geometry of human arteries, for example, have already been shown to better maintain the health of associated vessels than straight stents.\n\nMore broadly, mimicking the twisting path of arteries could improve the absorption in other flowing systems, either for distributing materials into the surroundings, or filtering them out of the flowing liquid."}, {"Source": "begonia's leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "focus light", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-focus-light/", "Strategy": "Leaves Focus Light\n\nThe leaves of begonias maximize photosynthesis in low-light conditions by using clear surface cells to focus light.\n\n“Begonias, which also grow on the floor of these Asiatic forests, have an additional trick. Some cells in the upper surface of their leaves are transparent and act as tiny lenses, gathering the feeble light and focussing it on to the grains of chlorophyll within.” \n\n“Many understory plants rely on diffuse light for photosynthesis because direct light is usually scattered by upper canopy layers before it strikes the forest floor. There is a considerable gap in the literature concerning the interaction of direct and diffuse light with leaves. Some understory plants have well-developed lens-shaped epidermal cells, which have long been thought to increase the absorption of diffuse light. To assess the role of epidermal cell shape in capturing direct vs. diffuse light, we measured leaf reflectance and transmittance with an integrating sphere system using leaves with flat (Begonia erythrophylla, Citrus reticulata, and Ficus benjamina) and lens-shaped epidermal cells (B. bowerae, Colocasia esculenta, and Impatiens velvetea). In all species examined, more light was absorbed when leaves were irradiated with direct as opposed to diffuse light. When leaves were irradiated with diffuse light, more light was transmitted and more was reflected in both leaf types, resulting in absorptance values 2–3% lower than in leaves irradiated with direct light. These data suggest that lens-shaped epidermal cells do not aid the capture of diffuse light. Palisade and mesophyll cell anatomy and leaf thickness appear to have more influence in the capture and absorption of light than does epidermal cell shape…Lens cells may then be more important for the focusing of direct light (Vogelmann et al., 1996) or for other reasons such as storing water and improving the hydrophobicity of the leaf surface. The development of these lens-shaped cells in understory tropical species may be primarily related to chance opportunities to exposure to direct light when sun flecks penetrate to the ground level of the forest. In addition, plants with these types of cells typically have an extremely hydrophobic surface, and convexly shaped cells increase water repellency (Wagner et al., 2003; Bhushan and Jung, 2006).”"}, {"Source": "phoruris firefly's scale", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "emit more light", "Function2": "increase the number of visible light beams", "Function3": "reflect more light", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/misfit-scales-emit-brighter-light/", "Strategy": "Misfit Scales Emit Brighter Light\n\nThe scales of the Phoruris firefly emit more light because misfit between scales increases the number of visible light beams.\n\nWhen a light beam hits a surface, the amount of visible light depends on the angle that the beam takes when approaching that surface.

Even in a desert the soil a little ways below the surface contains liquid water. It’s called ‘capillary water’ and is often thought of as firmly stuck to soil particles. The binding, though, is as much physical as chemical – the water in the soil interstices lie in tiny recesses between soil crumbs where it has minimized its exposed interface with air (Rose 1966). For the roots of a plant to extract the water requires making more surface, and thus it takes a very great pull, one that appears as an additional (negative) component of the pressure in the vessels running up a stem or trunk. The lowest (most negative) pressures known in plants occur in desert shrubs, which must suck really hard on the ground to get any water out. The most extreme value on record is, I think, minus 120 atmospheres (Schlessinger et al. 1982) – that would hold up a column water over 1,200 meters (4,000 feet) high.

Rain water soaks into the soil and is taken up by tree roots. Water vapor is released from the tree’s leaves and contributes to the creation of clouds and rain over the forest.\n\nTrees use water for many things: to cool their leaves down by “sweating” (i.e., transpiration), to give added support to each cell through water pressure, to serve as a source of hydrogen atoms for making molecules like glucose and cellulose, and as an anti-gravity conveyor belt transporting nutrients up from the soil throughout the tree’s many tissues.\n\nThis conveyor belt of water throughout the tree’s xylem tissues presents a major vulnerability: what if the water flow is somehow disrupted? Or, what if unwanted contaminants infiltrate the tree with the water entering its roots?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nXylem tissue is not comprised of continuous, hollow tubes or “straws” from a tree’s roots to its leaves. Instead, it is subdivided into smaller compartments of dead cells called tracheids, each just a few millimeters long, separated from one another by valves.\n\nThe valves consist of an opening in the cell walls between two adjacent tracheids, in the middle of which is a freely-moving membrane. The thin membrane responds to pressure differences between the two tracheids, moving to seal the aperture on one of the tracheid cell walls when there is a pressure difference between them. The size of the valves when open are 100-500 nanometers, small enough to prevent the passage of many types of potential contaminants and undesired microbes, but large enough to still allow water to flow through.\n\nThe valves also work to prevent an arboreal version of the bends. When an injury brings air into a tracheid, the lower pressure causes the valves of the cell to snap closed, preventing water from an adjacent cell from flowing into the first tracheid, and keeping the air from flowing into adjacent tracheids. The short length of each tracheid also ensures that air doesn’t penetrate far into the tree before a valve can shut it off.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe pressure-driven valves in xylem could have many applications in low-energy mechanical pumping systems, whether to move water or other substances.\n\nThe filtering system also holds promise for human application. Water-borne illnesses kill over a million people every year, especially in areas where water sanitation technologies are too financially intensive to be widely or effectively implemented. An inexpensive, readily available, effective water filter could improve water quality and prevent disease.

Lenticels are hydrophobic, so that while a root is covered by water they are in effect closed: neither air nor water can enter.

Because it is highly soluble in water, the carbon dioxide does not replace the volume of oxygen removed, and gas pressure within the root is therefore reduced. This is confirmed by direct measurement of gas composition in a submerged Avicennia root.

One unusual defense mechanism involves the flooding of their ocular sinuses, tissues found below their eye, with blood. When a horned lizard feels threatened by a predator, its final defense response is to shoot blood from these flooded sinuses and out its eye sockets. As a result, the predator is often frightened and flees. The lizard also uses this mechanism to remove foreign particles from the surface of its eyes.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nThe horned lizard has two constricting muscles that line the major veins around its eye. When these muscles contract, they cut off blood flow back to the heart, while it continues to flow into the head. This floods the ocular sinuses with blood, building pressure, and causing them to bulge. By further contracting these muscles in a rapid manner, the pressure increases even more, eventually rupturing the thin sinus membranes. The result is a jet stream of blood that can shoot up to four feet from the eye socket, a process known as auto-hemorrhaging. Amazingly, this process can be repeated several times within a short period if necessary, though the mechanism for this rapid recovery is not completely understood.\n \nThe lizard uses the same mechanism to remove particles from its eye, without rupturing the sinus membranes completely. When dirt, soil, or other particles enter the eye, the lizard controls the pressure precisely, allowing the sinuses to swell, but not hemorrhage. It then sweeps a thin, transparent third eyelid across the surface of the eye. This membranous eyelid folds back to the front corner of the eye, leaving the debris at the rear corner. The horned lizard then uses the bulging ocular sinuses to draw the debris away from the rear of the eye and onto the eyelid. Once the lizard floods its sinuses with blood, as described above, the skin surrounding the eyelids expands, dislocating the debris where it falls off or is otherwise easily removed.\n\nThe Potential \n\nEquipment used in liquid services such as pumps or filters need regular maintenance to keep them clean.

This transport occurs internally and is dependent upon the plant being alive (Rydin and Clymo 1989). This is somewhat surprising, since Sphagnum mosses lack specialized conductive tissue.

Even microorganisms must know when to stop absorbing nutrients from their environment before they reach toxic concentrations. The fungus, Aspergillus nidulans, developed a clever strategy centered around a membrane-bound transport protein called UapA that functions to import nitrogen sources, including uric acid and xanthine, into the cell. Once the cell is satiated with enough uric acid and xanthine, UapA is sent to the cell’s recycling machinery where it’s broken down to its constituent building block amino acids for use elsewhere. Curiously, it is the presence of uric acid and xanthine that trigger UapA to transport them into the cell in the first place, and it is these same compounds that mark UapA for recycling once the cell’s nitrogen requirements have been satisfied.\n\nUric acid and xanthine promote increased synthesis of UapA to facilitate their transport into the cell, but then induce break down of UapA once they are inside the cell. While the mechanisms are not yet fully understood, it appears that something inherent in the transportation of uric acid or xanthin across the cell membrane leads to subtle conformational changes in the shape of UapA, thereby signaling the cell to begin breaking it apart. It is attractive to hypothesize that the purpose of this unusual inhibitory pathway is to serve as a negative-feedback loop to prevent over accumulation of uric acid that may result in cellular damage. That may in fact be the case, but other pieces of evidence, including the low toxicity of uric acid to the fungus, shed doubt on the concept.

It captures its prey using tentacles that have a touch-sensitive head. When the head encounters movement, it activates a contracting mechanism (which is not yet fully understood but has two hypothesized mechanisms of its own) in the cells of the tentacle. The catapult mechanism is unique to this carnivorous plant; many other plants rely solely on the stickiness of their centers to trap prey. When the head becomes activated certain cells on the end closest to the plant body extend while cells farther out on the tentacle contract, causing the tentacle to bend upwards. In a 360-degree motion, the tentacle launches the prey to the center of the leaf. The movement of these snap-tentacles is a one-time motion. The tentacles cannot be utilized more than once due to hypothesized snapping of cells during the elongation/contraction process. The triggering of the head on the tip of the snap-tentacle is also highly precise; the head will not be triggered by vibrations from prey already trapped and must be activated via a ground-to-tentacle interaction.\n\nThe usefulness of these snap-tentacles is that they position the prey in a more vulnerable position in the center of the glue-tentacles, which reside in the middle of the trap leaf.

Did you ever wish you could do the same?\n\nHumans haven’t mastered this trick yet—but an undersea invertebrate known as Elysia chlorotica has. This tiny slug has evolved the ability to extract chloroplasts, which capture light energy, from the algae it eats. It then incorporates the chloroplasts into its own digestive tract cells, right below the surface of the skin. There the adopted organelles continue to turn sunlight into food, but this time for the slug directly.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nE. chlorotica slugs live in saltwater marshes along the East Coast of North America. After hatching from an egg, one will float around in the brackish water for three weeks or so. Then, when it encounters a patch of the alga Vaucheria litorea, it stops floating and starts feeding instead. But this isn’t any old meal.\nRather than chomp down on the entire alga, the slug punctures the cell with its radular tooth, and sucks out the juicy insides. In the process, it extracts the algae’s sunlight-trapping organelles, known as chloroplasts. The cells of the slug’s digestive tract then engulf the chloroplasts, carrying them into their insides. Even though they are no longer associated with their native organism, the chloroplasts continue to capture the energy of the sun. The slug then uses the resulting fixed carbon and energy to power its own cellular processes.\n\nAfter harvesting chloroplasts in this way for a week or so, the now bright green slug has adopted enough of the organelles that it can go the rest of its life—nine months or more—without needing to consume any more food.\n\nBut it’s not only about energy. The green color of the chloroplasts also helps the slug blend into the green algal bed and avoid predators. And if a predator does attack, the slug is protected by a mucus layer and chemical defenses built in part from the carbon byproducts produced by the chloroplasts.\n\nIt’s not easy being green: In order to reap the benefits of the chloroplasts, the slug needs to be able to position them near the surface of its body where sunlight can reach them. It needs to be able to produce any proteins the chloroplasts need to replace those that break or wear out. And it needs to avoid launching an immune reaction against the foreign bodies while still being able to protect itself against real invaders. Scientists are still trying to figure out exactly how E. chlorotica is able to accomplish all of this.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe ability to redirect the output of plants’ photosynthetic machinery could be applied to developing new approaches to capturing solar energy for human use.

Hiking along a goat trail at 3,000 meters’ elevation, you come across a field filled with white flowers—the famous edelweiss (Leontopodium nivale subsp. Alpinum), of story and song. That white color is not from petals of the flowers though, it’s an effect of the fuzz that covers stems, leaves, and bracts.\n\nThey may not look the part, but the tiny hairs are the functional equivalent of the sunscreen you as a hiker likely slathered on yourself earlier in the day. Both serve as protection from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\n\nThe intense energy of UV light can damage important constituents of living cells, including DNA, proteins, and membranes, ultimately harming or killing tissues or even entire organisms. But the fuzz, through an optical sleight-of-hand is able to protect the plant from harm.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe hollow hairs composing the fuzz are each about 10 micrometers in diameter—though that varies quite a bit—and are criss-crossed across the surface of the plant in a disheveled manner.\n\nEach one is made up of parallel fibers, each around 0.18 micrometers in diameter, which is close to the wavelength of UV light. When sunlight strikes its surface, the plant reflects most of the wavelengths that it doesn’t need for photosynthesis or other biological functions—except for UV. The fibers comprising the hairs neither reflect UV nor let it travel through to the plant uninhibited. Rather, the similarity between their size and the wavelength of the UV radiation causes the rays to bend in ways that trap them inside the fibers until their energy dissipates, preventing them from reaching and harming the cells below.\n\nThe fibers offer a bonus, too: they also help the plant retain moisture in the face of drying alpine winds and keep radiant heat close to the plant cells, reducing the risk of freezing.\n\nThe Potential\n\nEdelweiss’s approach to protecting its living tissues from UV radiation is different from those used by other organisms, which often reflect the rays using scales, fur, or other coatings. As a result, it offers unique inspiration for sheltering ourselves and other things we care about from UV light as well.\n\nIf the principle of trapping and weakening UV rays can be applied in a liquid or cream instead of fuzzy coating, one potential application is to develop non-toxic sunscreen to lather on our own skin. Because UV light alters paints and dyes and degrades plastics, edelweiss’s UV-absorption strategy could also be of value providing built-in, permanent protection for cars, house paints, textiles, and other manufactured surfaces that risk deterioration from the shorter-than-visible wavelength end of the electromagnetic spectrum."}, {"Source": "bladderwort's flexible trap walls", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "ultra-fast passive suction", "Function2": "release of stored elastic energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/flexible-walls-allow-for-ultra-fast-passive-suction/", "Strategy": "Flexible Walls Allow for\nUltra‑fast Passive Suction\n\nFlexible trap walls of the bladderwort allow for ultra-fast passive suction by relying on the release of stored elastic energy.\n\n“Carnivorous aquatic Utricularia species catch small prey animals using millimetre-sized underwater suction traps…Suction takes place after mechanical triggering and is owing to a release of stored elastic energy in the trap body accompanied by a very fast opening and closing of a trapdoor, which otherwise closes the trap entrance watertight…We found that this unique trapping mechanism conducts suction in less than a millisecond and therefore ranks among the fastest plant movements known.

It inserts its beak into the bloom, then, faster than the eye can see, flicks its long, forked tongue in and out, gathering up the energy-rich nectar inside.\n\nFor centuries, scientists have assumed the nectar-gathering depends on capillary action, in which laws of physics cause a liquid to rise in a tube formed by the two parts of the tongue curving toward each other.\n\nBut it turns out they were wrong: Slow-motion photography has revealed that rather than drawing nectar up into a tube, the two tongue parts gather nectar by soaking it up with brushlike structures and then retracting them into the bird’s beak.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nA hummingbird’s tongue is long and skinny, with two forks tipped by lots of hairlike structures, called lamellae. The lamellae are positioned on the inward-facing part of the forks, and are smaller closer to the tip, giving the tongue a cone shape when closed.\n\nWhen the bird maneuvers its beak into a blossom, it sticks out its pointy tongue into the pool of nectar at the base. The two parts of the tongue spread apart, and twist so the lamellae face outward. The lamellae extend, taking up the liquid much as your toothbrush takes up water when you rinse it. Then, as the hummingbird pulls  the tongue back into its beak, the blades rotate into their original cone-shaped position and trap the nectar between the two forks, carrying it with the tongue into the bird’s mouth. The entire process takes around 1/20th of a second.\n\nThe process has several advantages over capillary action. First, the amount of nectar gathered in each cycle is not limited by the size of the tube formed by the tongue. Second, the hairs on the tongue can gather nectar even when there’s not much there, as opposed to capillary action, which requires a minimum amount to be effective. The best part of all? The separation and rejoining of the two tongue blades and the furling and unfurling of the lamellae doesn’t require the expenditure of any energy from the hummingbird. Rather, they are an automatic result of the way the lamellae are configured, combined with the physical forces that act upon them in the process of entering and leaving the liquid. This means that it’s not only a slick trick, it’s an energy-efficient process as well.\n\nThe Potential This innovative strategy for moving fluids has a number of possible applications in design and engineering.

And in Namaqualand, the primary source of water is the air.\n\nPlants that grow in dry places have evolved a variety of strategies for making the most of the little water that’s there. For South African geophytes the focus is not so much on conserving water as it is on capturing it in the first place and directing it to their roots.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAir commonly contains water in two main forms: as a gas (known as water vapor) and as a liquid in tiny suspended droplets. When air with a lot of water vapor touches a surface that is cooler than itself, the vapor may condense to form liquid droplets as well.\n\nLike the grass in a field or lawn, South African geophytes cool down at night as they release warmth from daylight sun into the rapidly cooling air, creating conditions for dew to condense on their leaves. But they do your lawn grass one better. The extra surface area they have due to their curls and hairs helps them release heat even more quickly. As a result, they are more adept than other leaves at gathering water vapor from the air.\n\nThe curls and whorls and hairs help the geophytes gather fog as well. Water droplets in fog readily attach to surfaces they encounter. But the ability of any particular surface to gather fog droplets depends on what it’s made of, how much area it has, and how it is oriented relative to the source of the moisture. Broad surfaces tend to gather more moisture than narrow ones. And those perpendicular to airflow tend to gather more than those parallel to it. By curling and whirling, the plants increase the variety of orientation in their leaves, improving the odds that fog droplets will encounter and stick to them.\n\nThe presence of the water on the leaves helps the plants in three ways. First, it reduces the amount of water they lose from inside their tissues. Second, some water can be absorbed directly into the leaf tissue. Third, some water drips down onto the ground beneath the plant, where the roots can absorb it and make it available for photosynthesis.\n\nBy curling and whirling, the plants increase the variety of orientation in their leaves, improving the odds that fog droplets will encounter and stick to them.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe structures of South African geophytes offer insights for developing water-collecting devices for human use in regions that experience little rain but have at least intermittently abundant moisture in the air.\n\nThe water-collecting structures these plants have evolved could also provide inspiration for development of structures intended to harvest other substances from air or water. For example, configurations that expand surface area could boost the capacity of devices designed to counter global warming by capturing carbon dioxide from the air. Similarly, equipment designed to harvest microplastics or nanoplastics from air or water could use wavy or hairy structures to enhance their ability to encounter and capture these microscopic pollutants."}, {"Source": "leaves of some plants", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "absorb nutrient", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/stomata-absorb-nutrients-from-aerosols/", "Strategy": "Stomata Absorb Nutrients From Aerosols\n\nStomata on surface of leaves on some plants bind aerosol particles and liquefy and absorb them using atmospheric humidity.\n\nSome plants have adapted to competing for nutrient uptake by creating stomata that open in the presence of humidity. When these stomata open, the nutrients that have collected on the surface of the leaf are absorbed and transported into the leaf apoplast. The mechanism through which these plants do this is known as hydraulic activation of stomata, or “HAS.” The surfaces of plants are filled with grooves that collect aerosols over time. When these plants are in the presence of high humidity, moisture also begins to collect on the surface of the plant. As it does, the aerosols containing hygroscopic salts bind with the water. The presence of excess moisture from the humidity also causes the activation of certain stomata. As these stomata open, the fine aerosol particles that have bonded to the water are transported to the interior of the leaf where they can then be absorbed and utilized for their nutritional value."}, {"Source": "creeping dogwood's flower", "Application": "energy infrastructure", "Function1": "launch pollen", "Function2": "spread pollen", "Function3": "utilize physical principles", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/tiny-flower-unleashes-tremendous-force/", "Strategy": "Tiny Flower Unleashes Tremendous Forces\n\nA humble understory shrub launches pollen using water pressure and physics.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs spring-allergy sufferers know all too well, many plants rely on wind or animals to move pollen from flower to flower and help create the next generation of plants. This approach can seem like a pretty big gamble: How can you attract animals like honeybees with tasty pollen while not having too much of it eaten by those very same visitors? Or how can you make sure pollen you release gets caught by a breeze and doesn’t simply fall to the ground?\n\nCreeping dogwood (Cornus canadensis) is an unshowy, carpet-like shrub growing across forest floors in upper latitudes of the northern hemisphere. It’s small: the biggest plant might not reach your kneecaps. The forest floor may not be a breezy place, but the plant’s flowers have solved the challenge of pollen dispersal in a unique and ingenious way.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nDuring the spring, the plant soaks up water through its roots and stores some of it in its flower buds. The water pressure continuously builds as the fluid fills the bud with nowhere to go. When the flower finally explodes open, its petals peel back at nearly seven meters (23 feet) per second, one of the fastest movements by any organism. This is faster than the jaws of a Venus flytrap, or club strike of a mantis shrimp––faster even than Superman’s proverbial speeding bullet. The once-constrained stamens, now free, unfold upward, accelerating at an astounding 24,000 meters (15 miles) per second squared––800 times the gravitational forces experienced by astronauts leaving Earth on a rocket ship.\n\nThe clincher lies at the tip of the stamen’s filaments, where pollen-filled sacs (anthers) rotate freely with hinge-like motion. Inside the small flower, the already-split pollen sacs are held by compression against one another, preventing the pollen’s escape. But when the petals spring apart and release the stamens upward, the sacs spread apart just as the stamen’s unfolding filaments reach their zenith. The anthers then teacup around the now fully vertical filaments, providing a secondary boost that flings the nearly weightless pollen dust straight up into the air, ten times higher than the height of the flower itself.\n\nWhat happens next depends on who’s visiting. If it’s a bumble bee, whose weight is just right for triggering the flower’s explosion, the launched pollen envelops the bee’s furry body, making it more likely some of it will make it to another flower before being completely consumed. If it’s nothing but a breeze, the whisper-light pollen spreads out into a fine mist, where even the slightest passing air current transports it away.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe flowers of creeping dogwood create surprising mechanical advantage out of a little water and plant tissue––seemingly powerless components. Running more of our inventions with clean, locally-available energy sources reduces our need for expensive energy infrastructure like wires or toxic batteries. The humble garden sprinkler, for instance, rotates back and forth watering your lawn using nothing but some clever mechanical design and water pressure. Utilizing the physical principles behind the creeping dogwood pollen release, a world of inventive opportunity can spring open.\n"}, {"Source": "horse's metacarpal bone", "Application": "airplane wings", "Function1": "prevent structural weakness", "Function2": "absorb stresses", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hole-structure-strengthens-bone/", "Strategy": "Hole Structure Strengthens Bone\n\nA metacarpal bone of a horse avoids structural weakness caused by a hole via stress-dispersing microstructure.\n\nZebras, horses and other equine species put substantial stress upon their central forefoot bones, particularly the third metacarpal, bones with remarkable strength despite having holes in them for blood vessels to pass through. The presence of a hole (or foramen) in a structural element offers the potential for it to act as a site of stress concentration and initiation of cracks, yet these foramina do not weaken the bone nor act as fracture initiation sites. Hence the foramen in the third metacarpal of equine species has been of interest to engineers to learn how to design openings in structures in a way that avoids cracking. The key features investigators have found that minimize cracking at these sites are: their location in regions predominantly experiencing compression, their elliptical rather than round shape (oriented parallel to the long axis of the bone and the lines of force), the ‘softening’ of the material discontinuity by increased compliance of the tissue surrounding the opening that shifts peak stresses away from the foramen edge, and a ring of increased stiffness reinforcing the foramen at some distance from it to absorb those stresses shifted inward from the compliant foramen edge.

The plant cuticle is a thin, predominantly lipid layer that covers all primary aerial surfaces of vascular plants. Plant cuticle has been found in considerable amounts in both natural and agricultural soils. In most plant species, the major structural component of the plant cuticle is the cutin biopolymer (30–70% by weight). This is a high-molecular-weight, insoluble, polyester-like biopolymer, which is most often associated with waxes and cuticular polysaccharides. Cutin provides the structural framework for the cuticle and acts as a physical barrier, protecting the plant against microbial attack and water loss. In some plant species, the cutin biopolymer is associated with a base and acid hydrolysis resistant, polymethylene-like biopolymer, known as cutan. The function of the cutan is similar to that of the cutin, but in addition, it enhances the hydrophobic nature of the cuticle…Recently, it has been documented that plant cuticular matter exhibits high sorption capabilities for polar and nonpolar organic compounds…the objective of this study was to evaluate the role of important precursors for SOM, cutin and cutan biopolymers, as natural sorbents for organic compounds in soils.” \n\n“This study demonstrates the important role of the aliphatic biopolymers cutin and cutan as natural sorbents in soil. Although they were subjected to decomposition, they still exhibited a high sorption capacity. With humification and degradation, however, cutan is most likely to act as a highly efficient aliphatic-rich sorbent in soil. The cutan biopolymer is more likely to accumulate in soils via selective preservation, whereas the decomposed products of the cutin are probably transformed into humic-like substances during humification processes.”"}, {"Source": "mammalian cardiovascular and respiratory vessels", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "minimize the amount of biological work", "Function2": "optimal arrangement", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/optimal-branching-of-vascular-vessels-minimizes-work/", "Strategy": "Optimal Branching of Vascular\nVessels Minimizes Work\n\nVascular and respiratory vessels in mammals minimize the amount of biological work required to operate by being arranged hierarchically.\n\n“The vessels found in mammalian cardiovascular and respiratory systems are usually arranged in hierarchical structures and a distinctive feature of this arrangement is their multi-stage division or bifurcation.

We found that litter was restricted almost exclusively to the pits, and was greater in pits with larger openings. Litter capture was greater in ecotones and dunes than in swales. A total of 1307 seedlings from 46 genera germinated from litter samples taken from the pits, but no seedlings emerged from samples taken from soil surrounding the pits. Foraging pits contained significantly higher levels of total C and N than surrounding soil, and total C and N concentrations were greatest in swales and lowest in dunes. Pits contained ca 55% more mineralisable N that surface soils, and pits constructed by bilbies and bettongs contained half the concentration of mineralisable N as those of rabbits and goannas. Concentrations of mineral N and mineralisable N were also greatest in the swales.

They are relatives of the dandelions and ragworts that flourish as small yelllow-flowered weeds in European gardens. On Mount Kenya, they have evolved into giants. One grows into a tree up to thirty feet tall. Each of its branches ends in a dense rosette of large robust leaves. As the branches grow, so each year the lower ring of leaves in the rosette turn yellow and die. But they are not shed. Instead, they remain attached and form a thick lagging around the trunk. This is of crucial importance to the groundsel. The living leaves in the rosette contain special substances that prevent frost damage to the tissues and even though they may become covered by hoar frost during the night, they thaw out rapidly in the powerful warmth of the morning sun. But then the water within them starts to evaporate through their pores. If the liquid in the supply pipes running up through the trunk were to have frozen during the night, then the leaves would now be unable to replace their water and they would be baked dry and killed. The lagging of the dead leaves, however, prevents the pipes within the trunk from freezing and that particular danger is averted…The solution, however, generates another problem — this time a nutritional one. Retaining the dead leaves on the trunk prevents the nutrients in them from being released into the soil where they could be reclaimed by the roots.

This is not so in waterlogged soils, and special aerating devices are required. In growing Rhizophora, roots diverge from the tree as much as 2 m above ground, elongate at up to 9 mm d-1, and penetrate the soil some distance away from the main stem (Figs I.3, 1.4 and 5.1 [sic]). As much as 24 per cent of the above-ground biomass of a tree may consist of aerial roots: the main trunk, as it reaches the ground, tapers into relative insignificance […] On reaching the soil surface, absorptive roots grow vertically downwards, and a secondary aerial root may loop off and penetrate the soil still further away from the main trunk […] The method of aerating the underground roots is understood best in the red mangrove Rhizophora mangle of Florida. Functionally, the aerial components can be divided structurally into more or less horizontal arches and vertical columns. These have no problems in achieving adequate gas exchange, at least at low tide. In contrast, the underground roots are in a permanently hypoxic, or even anoxic, environment. The columns have the role of supplying oxygen to the underground roots. Air passes into the column roots through numerous tiny pores, or lenticels, which are particularly abundant close to the point at which the column root enters the soil surface. It can then pass along roots through air spaces. Roots entering the soil are largely composed of aerenchyma tissue; honeycombed with air spaces which run longitudinally down the root axis (Fig. 1.5) […] The importance of lenticels for gas exchange has been demonstrated by measuring O2 and CO2 concentrations in the aerenchyma of Rhizophora roots. When the lenticels are occluded by smearing grease over the aerial potion of the root, O2 declines continuously and CO2 rises (Fig. 1.6).

Rosette succulents make up a diverse group of plants that have successfully established in desert ecosystems, especially at the elevations at which clouds form.\n\nMany of them have relatively large leaves that store large volumes of water and are arranged in layers spreading out from around the base of the plant. This structure helps them to collect and store water from rain and fog, and is one of the keys to their success in these environments.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nConsidering their evolutionary history, fog is a relatively new source of water for these plants. Nonetheless, rosette succulents have developed several characteristics to help them make use of this resource.\n\nAgaves, for example, are highly efficient at harvesting water––even from fog and the lightest of rainfalls––thanks to the smooth surface of their leaves created by a waxy outer layer that also serves as a barrier to water loss. The water droplets in fog have a lot of surface area with which to make contact with other surfaces. With this high surface area, and being relatively lightweight, fog droplets are captured by an envelope of slow-moving air that surrounds a leaf and directed along its smooth surface. Species in cloud belts also tend to use that effect, as well as an arrangement of leaves that act like a funnel, to transport harvested water to their roots.\n\nIn higher altitude areas where fog is common, many rosette succulents have evolved to exhibit the “narrow-leaf syndrome.” This is a specific set of traits that can help increase a plant’s efficiency in capturing moisture from fog. Narrow and flexible leaves are better able to catch water droplets and direct their movement to the base, while a longer basal stem helps the plant catch more fog by holding it higher above the ground.\n\nThe Potential \n\nRosette succulents can serve as inspiration for ways we can harvest and store water from alternative, temporary sources like fog, for drinking and other uses.\nTheir strategy for removing moisture from the air can also be applied to enclosed spaces in which humidity control is necessary for maintaining livable conditions for people, plants, or animals. Some spaces that could benefit from this technology include indoor swimming pools, ice rinks, and stadiums, as well as large-scale enclosed habitats on land, in the sea, or beyond.\n\n"}, {"Source": "fern's sporangium", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "forcibly discharge spores", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/surface-tension-flings-spores/", "Strategy": "Surface Tension Flings Spores\n\nThe spores of one fern are launched from the sporangium using a mechanism based on surface tension and evaporation.\n\n“A mechanism based on the surface tension of water is used by a fern that forcibly discharges its spores from the sporangium–evaporation decreases the volume of water and increases the surface curvature in a series of cuplike dead cells until the sustainable cohesion is exceeded; water then vaporizes and tension is relieved by a movement analogous to that involved in throwing a spear (Steward 1968).”"}, {"Source": "goldfish", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "adapt to detect far-red and infrared light", "Function2": "detect light", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hunting-in-murky-water/", "Strategy": "Hunting in Murky Water\n\nGoldfish can hunt in murky environments because they are able to detect far-red and infrared light.\n\n“Like the piranha, the goldfish often inhabits murky, vegetation-choked stretches of freshwater in its natural habitat.

A forest’s canopy is the sum of its tree-crowns, including branches, twigs, leaves, and even the air that hovers in between.\n\nYet from the ground, one cannot appreciate the overstory’s entire story—it’s a place where thousands, maybe millions, of species have evolved, many of which never touch land. Scientists have long known of this diversity, but it wasn’t until the 1980s, when strong, affordable access equipment was invented, that our understanding of the canopy truly began. Equipment such as the canopy raft, a netted platform that a hot-air balloon lowers to the canopy’s top, was one of several innovations that helped answer the question of how to get up there so that scientists could start asking the question of how much is living up there.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nClimate determines a forest’s type. Tropical forests grow near the warm equator, boreal forests dominate cool northern latitudes, and temperate forests exist in between. Although climate affects what plants thrive in the overstory, microclimates created by canopies are what elicit plant diversity within them. Canopies absorb wind energy, heat, sunlight, and they cycle gases like water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, all of which promote different microclimates. Light, temperature, humidity, and available nutrients vary, even at the scale of individual leaves, allowing plants to find pockets where conditions suit their specific needs.\n\nIn a mountain forest in Ecuador, one study found as many as 109 distinct plant species on an area of branches no larger than a backyard patio. These were all epiphytes—nonparasitic plants that grow perched on other plants. Epiphytes collect water and nutrients not from the supporting plant itself,  but from their surroundings, laying down roots in a soil-like substance formed from decaying leaves, animal feces, and other canopy byproducts.\n\nSome epiphytes are vascular plants (like trees themselves), with specialized tissue to convey water and minerals. Forest overstories provide habitat for at least 24,000 species of vascular epiphytes, including types of succulents, ferns, and orchids. The forest canopy ecosystem is so conducive to biodiversity that it houses 10% of the world’s vascular plant species.\n\nTree canopies also support nonvascular epiphytes, including at least 10,000 species of mosses, 7,200 species of liverworts, and thousands of types of lichens, which are actually symbiotic organisms comprised of fungi and algae.\n\nCanopy-fostered plant diversity doesn’t end with epiphytes. Hundreds of species of hemiepiphytes also find refuge in forest canopies. These plants dwell in the canopy but connect in some way to the ground: some vine up trunks and can eventually lose their roots, while others sprout in the crown and lower roots to the soil below. Plant parasites, including 1,400 species of mistletoe, flourish in some canopies by tapping directly into a tree’s water and nutrient system, siphoning nourishment off of their hosts. The diversity of approaches to survival shows just how rich and attractive these arboreal ecosystems can be.\n\nThe Potential\n\nAs we learn how canopy microclimates stimulate biodiversity,  we may find ways to better protect plant species threatened by climate change and other human activities. We’re learning that mimicking microclimates saves energy when applied to our constructed environment as well. Rather than heating or cooling to a single target, some buildings use zonal controls. Architectural design elements can also take advantage of the sun and shade with materials that efficiently radiate heat, window awnings that passively cool air, and building orientations that optimize natural heating and cooling.\n\nOur increased understanding of the richness of the canopy may also have an impact on conservation and sustainable management of the forest. According to the World Bank, between 1990 and 2016, the world’s land area covered by forest decreased by over 500,000 square miles––equal to the combined areas of California, Texas, and Utah. Perhaps our growing understanding that each treetop is a forest of its own will drive us to better appreciate and protect trees individually and the forest as a whole."}, {"Source": "marsh pitcher's leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "long, slippery downward-pointing hairs", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hairs-cause-loss-of-footing/", "Strategy": "Hairs Cause Loss of Footing\n\nThe leaves of marsh pitchers guide insects into a water trap via long, slippery hairs.\n\n“The marsh pitcher’s trap is a very simple one.

Recently, however, many have started to accept that there are birds and mammals that have feelings and senses, suffer when hurt, and form coalitions and alliances with other individuals to improve their own conditions.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIn an English wildlife reserve, scientists studied flocks of four species of flamingos. These long-lived wading birds feed and breed in large flocks sometimes numbering in the thousands in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The scientists found that flamingos preferred hanging out with the same small groups of other flamingos. These included groups of two, three, or four, and these social bonds lasted for years. But it’s not all friendly; there are also birds that avoid each other.\n\nFlamingos live in habitats where survival is difficult. For example, the Andean flamingo lives in the high elevation Andes Mountains of South America. They spend the summer feeding in salty lakes and migrate to lower elevation wetlands for the winter. Having stable relationships with other flamingos may help them find food, improve access to mates, and cope with sources of stress such as food shortages or human disturbance.\n\nThe Potential \n\nIn a zoo, it may be useful to keep track of friendships among marked flamingos.

A healthy ecosystem includes multiple species that serve similar functions or roles – for example, more than one species that fertilizes the soil and more than one that controls the population of a certain predator. This redundancy is crucial to supporting the long-term stability of the ecosystem because natural disturbances – such as fires, disease, or changing climate – can sometimes eliminate entire species unable to survive the change. With redundancy in environmental function, if one species dies off, another species that serves a similar role is more likely able to react and thrive after the disturbance. It can then take the place of the previously dominant species, thereby keeping the ecosystem resilient.\n\nFor example, consider a situation in which a prairie grassland ecosystem’s main food-producing plant is completely destroyed by a fire. A plant species that was previously less abundant may now be better suited to live in the new soil conditions, and therefore become the new dominant food-producing plant species serving the grassland.

One species provides something for the other and in exchange, receives something good in return. One example is the relationship between fig trees and fig wasps that has evolved for longer than 60 million years.\n\nIn any mutual relationship, there needs to be some way to maintain balance. Otherwise, one partner might take advantage of the other. In Australia, there is a species of fig tree that is pollinated by a specific wasp, known as a fig wasp.\n\nThe figs of the tree are sweet fruit full of small seeds. The flowers are tiny and found inside the fig, attached to the inside wall (see photo and illustration). As with any flowering plant, a fig can’t produce seeds without being pollinated. The tiny fig wasp pollinates the plant as it enters the fig. It spreads pollen around as it lays its eggs inside the flowers’ ovules. The eggs eventually grow into adult wasps and leave to pollinate other trees. However, the fig wasp doesn’t lay its eggs in all of the ovules, leaving some to grow into the seeds that crunch when you eat the fig.\n\nWhat keeps the fig wasp from laying eggs in all of the ovules? Another partner in this three-way mutualism is a parasitic wasp. It uses its long egg-laying tube to pierce the outside of the fig and lay its own eggs into the ovules with the fig wasps’ eggs (the red ovals in illustration). The parasitic wasps’ young then eat the young of the fig wasp. However, the egg-laying tube isn’t long enough to reach all of the ovules, just the ones closest to the surface. As a result, to escape the parasite, the fig wasp tends to lay most of its eggs in the “enemy-free zone” deepest inside the fig (the blue ovals in the illustration). This leaves the outer ones (yellow ovals) free to develop into seeds and create the next generation of trees.\n\nWhat can we learn from the mutualistic relationship between the fig tree, wasp and parasite? Sometimes, we need to rethink something we might automatically think of as “bad”, like parasitism. The parasitic wasp is an important  member of this relationship. By limiting where the fig wasp lays its eggs, the parasite allows the fig tree to produce seeds to make the next generation of fig trees. This in turn benefits the fig wasp, as it has another generation of trees to pollinate and lay eggs for its young."}, {"Source": "ant's chemical signal", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "stimulate honeydew production", "Function2": "prevent aphid dispersal", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/chemicals-control-aphid-activity/", "Strategy": "Chemicals Control Aphid Activity\n\nAnts use chemical signals to control aphid dispersal and collect their honeydew for food.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpecies often find innovative ways to make use of others beyond a simple predator-prey relationship, intertwining their existence in a way that can bring benefits to one or both species. Ants are a great example of this, having developed ways of manipulating other insects for their own gain, including the aphids that for humans are persistent garden pests.\n\nBy understanding these species pairings, we can sometimes use them for our own benefit, such as targeting a pest species with a parasite or other biological control.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAs social insects, ants live in large, structured colonies with designated roles for each individual. The queen ant lives her entire life under the protection of the rest of the colony, growing and producing eggs as the sole reproductive individual. Other female ants act as foragers and scouts, searching out sources of food to return to the colony.\n\nBut foraging for food takes a lot of energy, so some ants have found ways to make other species produce food for them. The black garden ant (Lasius niger, found in kitchens and backyards around the world) has developed a clever way of using aphids to produce food. The black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, feeds on the phloem sap of plants and produces a sweet, sugary fluid called honeydew as a byproduct. This honeydew is more nutritious and attractive to ants than the aphids themselves, so rather than prey upon the aphids, the ants “milk” them by using touch to stimulate the release of honeydew. They’ll even corral the aphids in order to collect the honeydew efficiently, similar to the way humans manage dairy cows.\n\nHoneydew is more nutritious and attractive to ants than the aphids themselves, so rather than prey upon the aphids, the ants “milk” them by using touch to stimulate the release of honeydew.\n\nThe ants control the movement of the aphids in a number of ways. In addition to physically removing their wings to prevent them from flying to new host plants, the ants produce a chemical that has a tranquilizing effect on the aphids, preventing them from dispersing without reducing their honeydew production.\n\nChemicals that convey signals for other organisms are known as semiochemicals, and they can be used to communicate with individuals of the same species or that of other species. In fact, it’s not just animals that can produce these chemicals––many studies have shown that when under attack by aphids or other insect pests, plants often respond by emitting semiochemicals, which attract aphid predators such as ladybugs. The chemicals also work as airborne signals that can trigger surrounding plants to produce their own defenses in preparation of aphid infestation.\n\nOne of the chemicals produced by plants as a response to aphid presence is dendrolasin, which is the same chemical used by the ants to tranquilize aphids and prevent them from dispersing. Like good shepherds, the ants are quick to defend the aphids when predators show up to attack. In fact, the ants tend their colonies so effectively that they enable the aphids to continue to thrive under conditions that would normally cause them to disperse to other plants. And when a plant’s resources are exhausted, ants will carry their aphid colony to optimal plants nearby.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFor humans, aphids don’t yield sweet nectar, they colonize and feed on many important crops, resulting in significant losses in yield. They also spread plant diseases as they exhaust the resources on one plant and move on to the next. Our knowledge of the complex relationships between ants and aphids can help us to think beyond broadscale use of pesticides, and to protect crops in more natural and sustainable ways.

These relationships range from mutually beneficial to parasitic. From the perspective of a plant that depends on animals for its pollination, it would be ideal to attract a pollinator using as little of its own energy and resources as possible.\n\nThe Orchidantha inouei plant, found in Borneo, has mastered this strategy by emitting a smell that attracts Onthophagus dung beetles without offering any reward (such as nectar) for pollinating its flowers.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nBeetles of the Onthophagus genus dig tunnels below dung or carrion to transport the goods to a burrow where it is stored for use as food for the adult beetles and as a nursery for the larvae.\nThe trick to attracting these beetles then is to stink. The scent emitted by O. inouei seems to be more of a general dung-like odor, as it doesn’t smell distinctly enough like dung or carrion to attract dung or carrion flies. Luckily for the plant, the dung beetles aren’t discerning enough to tell the difference.\nLike orchids, O. inouei has a labellum—a petal at the bottom of a flower that can be larger and shaped differently from the rest—that serves as a platform for pollinators to enter the flower. As a dung beetle crawls into the flower, it gets pollen on its back from the stamen that’s hidden among the petals. The stigma, which is the part of the flower that receives pollen from other flowers and is located in the same area of the flower as the stamen, secretes a mucus-like substance that could possibly work like a glue to hold the pollen onto the beetle’s back until it finds the flower of another O. inouei plant. The strategy used by O. inouei is appropriately called “deceit pollination”.\n\nThe Potential\n\nDirect utilization of this dung-like scent might have limited applications for humans, but the chemistry behind it could inspire other scent-based attractants or repellents.\n\nThere is also a model we can learn from in the unbalanced benefits of the system. The flower may be taking advantage of the beetle, but not to a degree that is greatly harming the benefactor. The flower may not be offering the beetle any benefit yet identified, but it is not taking so much advantage as to hinder the beetle’s fitness for survival and reproduction.

They held them in place, keeping them stable and upright for decades or even centuries. But those life-saving anchors also prevent trees (or any plants) from moving to spread their seeds. So plants have devised inventive ways to disperse seeds—to avoid competing with their own offspring for resources and to expand their range.\n\nSome plants produce fruits to entice animals to carry away seeds. Others rely on winds and water to do the same. One common weed, the popping cress, has evolved a way to launch its seeds in an explosive burst that gives the plant its name.\n\nIts seeds are encased in a slender oblong pod. With a loud pop, the pod splits open and its sheaths curl back rapidly—like a coiled paper party horn when you stop blowing into it. Within half a millisecond, scores of tiny seeds are violently ejected outward in all directions. They accelerate to speeds of 22 miles per hour (10 meters per second) and land 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.25 meters) away.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe mechanism that accomplishes this effective outburst is as fascinating as it is complex.\n\nThe pods have different layers. The outer layer has soft, pliable cells that curl easily. But an inner layer of cells contains a strong, stiff compound called lignin. It resists curling, and the pod stays straight.\n\nThe lignin is shaped like a “U” cupping the bottom of the inner-layer cells. But if you apply enough force on lignin, it reaches a threshold that instantly overcomes its resistance. The two sides of the “U” slap downward and the inner layer suddenly curls open. The structure is called “bistable,” because it has two stable states and rapidly shifts between them. It works like a toy snap bracelet or a thin metal tape measure, which can maintain its rigidity until you snap it—and then it bends immediately.\n\nIn the case of popping cress, water is the key to building up tension. As the pod grows, water fills the cells in the flexible outer layer causing their cell walls to expand. That substantially builds up tension against the lignin in the inner-layer. In this way, the system builds up potential elastic energy slowly but can release it rapidly.\n\nWhen the tension on the lignin finally flattens its rigid U-shape, all that pent-up tension is released in just 3 milliseconds and the pod splits open. Pod sheaths curl back with a powerful snap that hurls the seeds with ballistic force up and outward like exploding fireworks.\n\nPopping cress is a common weed with an uncommon method of dispersingits seeds. Scientists figured out the fascinating mechanisms by whichpopping cress seed pods burst open explosively to hurl seeds far and wide.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe popping cress has evolved an effective system to build up potential elastic energy and instantly convert it into strong kinetic energy. Understanding its structural components and the physics underlying how they work together offers lessons on how to design robotic manipulators and ballistic systems.\n\nThe plant also inspires design systems that can monitor and respond to environmental conditions and take advantage of the circumstances in exotic locales to produce energy. Such innovations could lead to biomimetic solutions for challenges to remote exploration in unknown locales, including space missions."}, {"Source": "bottlenose dolphin", "Application": "creative foraging strategy", "Function1": "build community and friendships", "Function2": "develop skills and knowledge", "Function3": "boost the survival of offspring", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/juvenile-dolphins-choose-friends-to-help-through-life/", "Strategy": "Juvenile Friendships Help Throughout Life\n\nBottlenose dolphins develop lifelong friendships early on that will benefit them through shared information, cooperation, and other means.\n\nIntroduction \n\nHow do our early years help to prepare us for the demands of adulthood?\nWhile some species reach sexual maturity at a young age and produce many offspring, dolphins (like humans and other large social species such as elephants) have a prolonged development stage in early life. From weaning to first pregnancy, this stage lasts about 10 years, and appears crucial for developing the relationships and survival skills needed as adults.\n\nResearchers wanted to know more about the way that dolphins use this juvenile period to develop these skills, and whether the different demands on adult males and females would be seen in the ways that juveniles spend their time. Cataloging unique markings on the dorsal fins of a group of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, they were able to follow individuals from birth to adulthood.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nAs adults, female dolphins care for (and feed) offspring for 3-4 years. In contrast, adult male dolphins spend more time socializing in groups with other males, and aren’t involved in raising the young. This leads each sex to require a different set of skills needed to succeed as adults.\n\nDolphins share foraging strategies with their friends, demonstrating the importance of the social bonds developed throughout their lives.\n\nIn both males and females, dolphins choose their friends carefully, spending more time with these individuals and strengthening these bonds throughout their lives. For males, this helps them form alliances that boost their success in securing a mate. Some males have been found to maintain these strong friendships for more than 30 years.\n\nYoung females spend significantly more time foraging than males. This helps to prepare them for the future high energy demands of pregnancy and raising a calf. As adults, females tend to group with other females and their offspring, which provides some protection to the calves while also facilitating the sharing of information.\n\nResearchers have observed dolphins sharing knowledge about creative ways to use tools to capture fish prey. One of these strategies, first observed in the Shark Bay dolphins in 1984, involves a dolphin holding a sea sponge in its mouth to protect its nose while rooting through the sandy sea floor. This method enables dolphins to find bottom-dwelling fish that hide in the sand.

These locusts typically feed, move, and go about their lives independently––and even actively avoid each other in normal circumstances. However, if a locust is forced to be around other locusts, its behavior changes completely. This locust will become more attracted to others and will gather with other locusts that undergo the same change in behavior. Thus, a swarm is formed.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nSwarming may be caused by an overabundance of locusts in general––a response to crowding to help locusts find food when there isn’t much left.\n\nThe sudden socialization of locusts is triggered either by physical touch from other locusts detected by the hind legs, or by simply the sight and smell of other locusts nearby.\n\nSeeing and smelling other locusts increases the serotonin levels in a locust. In humans, the serotonin hormone plays numerous roles throughout the brain and body, but is most well-known for contributing to feelings of happiness and well-being. Serotonin may play a similar role in desert locusts, causing them to gather with other locusts in order to maintain higher levels of serotonin.\n\nThe spike in serotonin lasts for less than 24 hours, but it only takes two hours of exposure to other locusts to flip the switch that makes a locust go from self-isolating to a social butterfly. The higher the spike in serotonin, the more social a locust becomes. Desert locusts can be prevented from becoming sociable by being injected with chemicals that keep their serotonin levels in check, or that prevent serotonin from being produced altogether. These chemicals are effective even when a locust is stimulated with physical touch.\n\nBeyond the two-hour minimum, locusts become more social the longer they are near each other. This can result in a cycle where swarms grow bigger and remain intact for longer periods, which is bad news for the crops they feed on.\n\nThe Potential \n\nMore research is needed to understand the role of serotonin in influencing the behavior of the desert locust and its relatives. A better understanding could help inform our methods of pest control to protect agricultural areas from the damage of locust swarms.

At a glance it may look like a splash of paint, but patient observation reveals it creeping across surfaces by oozing forward in fingerlike projections.\n\nEven though it doesn’t have a brain, the slime mold exhibits a simple form of learning by changing its behavior based on past experience. It also can pass what it learns to another slime mold simply by fusing with it for a couple of hours. Scientists discovered this by giving different slime molds a chance to creep across a tiny bridge made of salt (which they usually avoid) to reach a food reward.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe setup of the experiment was simple: A group of slime molds was taught to cross a bridge without salt. Next, half of those slime molds were exposed to a bridge with salt. They were repelled at first, but eventually crossed anyway. The other half were not exposed to a salt bridge.\n\nWhen both groups were later given a chance to cross a salt bridge, the slime molds that had experience with a salt bridge traveled across the “yuck” to get to the “yum” more quickly than the others. Then, when a slime mold that had learned to tolerate the salt in order to reach the treat merged with another slime mold, the second slime mold also readily crossed the salt bridge—even after being separated from its partner—as long as the two had been together longer than an hour and had formed a connecting structure between them.\n\nThe Potential \n\nHow slime molds learn and share learning is still a mystery. Some scientists think it might be related to how genes are expressed, to the structure of the veins, or to how chemicals interact within the slime. But even though we don’t know how it works, this ability to learn without a brain offers valuable insights for innovation. Researchers have turned to slime mold for help solving difficult computational problems such as finding shortest paths and building better networks. And efforts to design artificial intelligence and machine learning systems can use the bright but brainless creature as inspiration for developing new approaches to learning—and sharing knowledge—without the need for a central hub.\n"}, {"Source": "bison grazing", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "increase biodiversity", "Function2": "support native plant and animal species", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fire-and-bison-grazing-in-grasslands-lead-to-diversity/", "Strategy": "Fire and Bison Grazing in\nGrasslands Lead to Diversity\n\nThe interaction of two disturbances—bison grazing patterns and fire—increases biodiversity by creating a heterogeneous patchwork of plant communities in grasslands.\n\n\nIntroduction \n\nThe Great Plains are a huge expanse of grassland located west of the Mississippi River and east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada. Millions of bison used to roam the tallgrass prairies that once covered the Great Plains, grazing in patches as they went. Fires caused by lightning or set intentionally by native peoples to renew the grasslands were also common. The relationship between fire and grazing patterns had a big impact on how plant communities developed in the tallgrass prairie.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nFires are important to biodiversity, because bison prefer to graze patches of grassland that have been burned recently. Bison grazing patterns also influence the size and intensity of fires. The interactions between these two different types of disturbances— fires and grazing patterns—helps create a heterogenous, or mixed, patchwork of plant communities. For example, these interactions lead to different plant heights, density, and mixtures of species. This helps support more biodiversity in tallgrass prairie ecosystems.\n\nScientists think of biodiversity on three levels—genetic diversity (different genes and combinations within a species), species diversity (the number of different species within an ecosystem), and ecosystem diversity (how many different ecosystems are found in a region). Biodiversity helps organisms adapt to environmental changes, maintain food webs, and provide services that life depends on, such as water retention and waste decomposition.\n\nToday, most of the land that made up the Great Plains is managed as rangeland for cattle production. Land managers usually only manage the number of cattle and where and when they are grazing on the land. Fire is rarely used anymore as a way to manage cattle grazing. Instead, intensive rotational grazing approaches, where animals are moved rapidly between heavily grazed plots, have become more popular as a management approach. This style of grazing allows the plants that the cattle most like to eat to recover between grazing sessions. However, it does not produce the patchwork of plants that leads to greater biodiversity.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe Nature Conservancy has successfully used fires and continual cattle grazing to manage its Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma. This approach helps to promote biological diversity and increases agricultural productivity, and can help  support native plant and animal species. There is even some evidence that this approach, where appropriate, could reduce the need for protein supplements in cattle during winter months.

We don’t tend to think about the potential function of all this noise that other animals produce, but research on animal communication has slowly built up a startling picture of just how much communication is actually going on. Scientists have found that birds and mammals broadcast warnings about nearby predators, for example, and understand each other’s messages. They can even share information on what kind and size of predator is around, and what it’s doing.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nBlack-capped chickadees are tiny black and white birds who live in forests. They’re best known for their “chickadee dee dee” calls. These and some other calls keep birds in contact with each other or let each other know where to find food. Less noticed by humans is a very quiet, high-pitched “seet” call. They use this call to warn others that there’s a hawk or owl flying nearby.\n\nChickadees also have another call when they see a perched hawk or owl. It’s a louder and longer version of its usual “chickadee dee dee” call. This altered call draws in other birds to “mob” the predator. The more dangerous the predator is to the chickadees, the more times they say “dee”. For example, the tiny northern pygmy-owl, who eats a lot of chickadees, gets a lot of “dee” calls. The bigger great horned owl is less of a threat and so the birds make fewer “dees”. The harsh “chickadee dee dee” means the chickadee sees a hawk or owl and needs other nearby birds to mob the predator until it flies away.\n\nThe “seet” call has a different purpose. Because it’s so quiet and high-pitched, it’s hard for a predatory bird to hear. That means it’s a safer call for a chickadee to make compared to the deeper, louder “chickadee dee dee.” The “seet” call warns other chickadees to hide when a hawk or owl is flying nearby. Like an early warning system, the alert can spread through a forest from one bird to another faster than the hawk can fly. By the time the predator arrives, the birds are safely in hiding.\n\nOther species, including nuthatches, jays, squirrels, and chipmunks can also listen to the chickadees’ warnings. Birds in other regions also react to the “seet” call even if chickadees don’t live in the area. Scientists have played a recording of the chickadee’s “seet” call all over the world, and other birds understood it and took cover.\n\nThe early warning system goes beyond directly saving birds and mammals from predators. This cooperation allows them to spend less time watching for predators and more time getting the food they need to survive.\n\nThe Potential \n\nFurther research could decode more sound signals that have near-universal meanings, reopening lines of communication between humankind and other species. Technologies which tap into these patterns of communication could help make humankind a better participant in the conversation, and thus a better neighbor to those species. Speakers could be placed on skyscrapers near flyways to prevent avian collisions with difficult-to-see architectural glass, or around airports to reduce collisions with airplanes.\n\nGardeners and farmers could also use knowledge about communication among birds to repel birds or other organisms that eat crops, or to attract organisms that feed on species that have other detrimental effects on agriculture."}, {"Source": "prairie ecosystems", "Application": "soil remediation", "Function1": "use water and nutrient efficiently", "Function2": "prevent erosion and water pollution", "Function3": "conserve water", "Function4": "sequester carbon", "Function5": "build a healthy agricultural system", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/natural-ecosystem-demonstrates-sustainability/", "Strategy": "Natural Ecosystem Demonstrates Sustainability\n\nDiversity and life-span of plants help prairie ecosystems use water and nutrients efficiently.\n\n\nAll across the world, the best soils for growing grains like wheat and corn are in areas that used to be prairies. Prairie soils are high in the nutrients that plants need, and have a crumbly, spongy texture that soaks up and holds water. These rich topsoils result from symbiosis between plants and soil microbes such as fungi and bacteria.\n\nWhen we clear prairies for agriculture, it is usually for annual crops.  Annuals are plants which grow, produce seeds, and die all in one year, so their seeds are planted every year.  Before replanting, farmers often till the soil. That is, they dig and turn the soil to pull out the roots and stems of old plants. Tilling has caused the rich prairie top soils to erode and wash into water bodies, such as lakes, rivers, and bays.  At the same time, soil nutrients lost from farmlands need to be replaced somehow in order for the crops to grow.  Many farms solve this problem by using fertilizers every year.  Without the prairie’s symbiotic microbes, the soil cannot soak in or hold as much water, so the plants also require farm irrigation. However, without the spongy soil texture, that water runs off the fields and takes even more soil and the fertilizer with it. In this way, the cycle of erosion, fertilization, and irrigation keeps on and on.  Meanwhile, the heavy load of soil and nutrients cause major pollution problems in aquatic habitats.  These problems are becoming worse with climate change, because hotter, drier climate means that crops need even more irrigation. With that irrigation comes more erosion, water shortages, and increasing hardship for farmers who grow food.\n\nFortunately, scientists and farmers are finding new ways to grow the food the world needs without these problems.  The key to the solution is understanding how prairie habitats work, and how their soils became so rich in the first place.\n\nUnlike our grain crops that are annuals, most prairie plants are perennials.  This means that after they have produced seeds, their leaves may turn brown and fall off, but their roots stay alive underground. The following growing season, the healthy roots keep growing larger and deeper as the plants send up new leaves, and produce seeds again.  The living roots soak up water, hold down the soil, and prevent erosion. Old leaves and stems get broken down by symbiotic microbes, which help the plants take up the nutrients. In exchange, the plants send sugars down their ever-deepening roots that feed the microbes and help increase their populations.\n\nIn this way, perennial plants, with roots that stay alive all year long, build an ecosystem in which water, plentiful microbes, healthy plants, and soil nutrients build a sustainable cycle.  Together, they prevent erosion and water pollution, and conserve water.  Another major climate benefit of prairies is that perennials sequester, or lock in, carbon. The plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and put it into long term storage in the living plant tissue and also buried deep in the soil.  This is a major strategy for slowing down climate change and building a healthy agricultural system.\n\nBy studying the diversity of prairies, scientists have learned which types of plants play a role in keeping the system self-sustaining.  For example, legumes have symbiotic root fungi that leak nitrogen into the soil. This extra nitrogen gets taken up by neighboring plants. The flowers of some herbs attract pollinators that visit and pollinate many other plants as well.  Perennial grasses produce deep roots, whose important role is explained above.  If agriculture can mimic this combination of plant types, and develop grain types that are perennial, perhaps we can grow enough food while also restoring the prairie’s ability to use water and nutrients sustainably.\n"}, {"Source": "oilbird", "Application": "vibration control", "Function1": "find large objects", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/echolocation-enables-navigation-in-total-darkness/", "Strategy": "This Bird Can Find Large\nObjects in Total Darkness\n\nWhile bats use high-pitched, inaudible sounds to find tiny insects, oilbirds use lower-pitched, audible sounds to sense walls, fruit, and other large objects.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nLiving in a pitch-dark cave is a superb strategy for a bird seeking to avoid predators that hunt by sight. But it creates a second survival dilemma: How to avoid debilitating collisions with walls, ceilings, and other birds?\n\nThe oilbird has a sound solution—literally. An inhabitant of forests in South America and Trinidad, this big bird roosts and nests in caves and emerges at night to forage on fruit in nearby trees. While finding its way around in the deep dark of a cavern—and sometimes when it’s foraging on a moonless night—the bird contracts its respiratory system in a way that allows it to emit quick bursts of audible clicks. The sound waves bounce off objects, returning to the bird’s ears in a way that allows it to determine the objects’ sizes and locations and so avoid smashing into them.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nUnlike bats, which use short-wavelength ultrasound to detect tiny insects, oilbirds use clicks that are in the range that’s audible to humans as well as to themselves. That means the sound waves they produce are only good for detecting larger objects such as other birds and fruit, perhaps down to the size of a grape. But it clearly is good enough to meet their needs for navigating without the aid of sight.\n\nThe clicking sound an oilbird makes is the result of contraction of two sets of muscles in its syrinx—a set of membranes in the bronchial tubes of birds leading from the trachea to the lungs. The tissue around each branch of the syrinx contracts, folding a membrane inward. The bird then exhales a puff of air past the membrane and contracts the second set of muscles, creating the click. It makes the clicks in small bursts of two to seven individual sounds, taking “mini-breaths” as needed to move the air past the clicking mechanism without requiring a full inhale. The echoes return to the bird’s ears at different levels of loudness and intensity.\n\nThe larger the object, the more sound waves are deflected. This enables the bird to identify the size, shape, and location of the obstacle. Short clicks rather than loud, prolonged sounds reduce interference between the sound the bird is making and the echo bouncing back, making it possible to detect objects nearby as well as far away.\n \nThe Potential\n\nHumans already use audible-range echolocation in certain contexts. Some sight-impaired individuals use it to find their way around, clicking as they move and listening for how the sound is deflected by objects they wish to approach or avoid. It’s also used in technology, usually for underwater navigation. The oilbird’s lower-frequency sonar might provide guidance for additional applications though, such as drone navigation in the air, or even robot-assisted surgery.\n\nThe oilbird’s mechanism for making rapid sounds could provide valuable insights for controlling sound or other vibration production within narrow specifications. This might be applied to anything from creating new musical instruments to transforming the noise from wind turbines."}, {"Source": "lance-tailed manakins", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "attract mate", "Function2": "courtship dance", "Function3": "cooperative breeding", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/males-cooperate-to-attract-a-mate/", "Strategy": "Males Cooperate to Attract a Mate\n\nMale lance-tailed manakins attract a female by doing a cooperative courtship dance.\n\n\nIn a forest in Panama, two male birds wait on a bare branch. They’ve already cleared a stage for their upcoming performance by removing leaves from neighboring plants. Suddenly a female lands on the branch and the two males go into action. Over the next few minutes, these two males put on a coordinated courtship dance with 11 different moves and 9 types of songs and calls. But these two birds aren’t competing, they’re cooperating. Only one, the alpha, will get to mate with the female. The alpha and beta males may work together for up to six years. Eventually, the beta might move on to become an alpha.\n\nThese birds are lance-tailed manakins. With their black bodies, bright blue capes, and dark red cap, they are conspicuous among the greenery of the forest. Like other species of manakins, a beta male helps the alpha put on a courtship display. Researchers are trying to figure out what the advantages are to being a beta. Not all alpha birds have a beta helper and some birds skip being a beta helper and immediately become alphas. The alpha and beta birds are not related to one another, so there’s no clear genetic advantage. One possible advantage is that the betas gain experience that makes them better at courtship displays later in life.\n\nCooperative courtship is one type of cooperative breeding, where other members of a species help the breeder to succeed, either through courtship or caring for young. Cooperative breeding is widespread in the animal world. It’s found in almost 90 species, mostly birds, fish, and mammals. It may just be one route to successful breeding, or there may be advantages scientists haven’t yet found. More and more, scientists are realizing that cooperation among and between species plays a big role in nature, from tiny microbes to giant whales.

This affects plants by decreasing the rate of pollination, as fewer individuals are available to move pollen between plants, which decreases the number of plant offspring produced. In order to counteract the low numbers of both pollinator species and pollinator population sizes, plant species belonging to the ericad family have developed an interesting strategy. They stagger their flowering times, so they don’t overlap. This increases the rate of successful pollination, as there are fewer flowers to visit at any one time, thus reducing competition for pollinators, and ensuring that pollen is transferred to another member of the species. Differences in cold tolerance determine the sequential flowering times. The higher a plant’s cold tolerance, the sooner after a frost it can start to produce pollen. These differences result in different flowering times, reduced competition for pollinators, more targeted pollination, and ultimately increased rate of successful reproduction for the plants."}, {"Source": "beaver dam", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "change stream flow", "Function2": "create a patchwork of habitat diversity", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/beavers-remodel-land-and-stream-ecosystems/", "Strategy": "Beavers Remodel Land and Stream Ecosystems\n\nBeaver dams change stream flows and create a patchwork of habitat diversity.\n\n\nBeavers are large rodents known for building dams. To build their dams, they chew through living trees until they fall over. Beavers choose trees that will fall across a stream when they topple over, which stops water from flowing and causes a pond to form. In that pond, a family of beavers uses twigs and mud to build a lodge emerging above the water.  They will spend winter and spring there with their young, protected from predators by water and hard mud walls, with plenty of plants and bark for food close by.  They return to these same lodges every year,  repairing and sometimes extending the dam so it takes up an even larger area.\n\nThe beaver pond grows in size as the dam stops more and more water, until eventually it overtops the stream bank and floods the surrounding land.  As water fills in low-lying areas, new streams and ponds can form.  Some areas remain flooded year-round or seasonally for many years.  Forests that used to line the stream bank become waterlogged and die.  Eventually they are replaced by wetland plants that are better adapted to life in watery soils, and colonized by animals that live with these plants.  Over years and decades, there are even more ecological changes in this landscape.  For example, once the beavers abandon their lodges, debris collects behind the dams and can form islands. As water flows around the island, it can split into smaller streams.  This creates new water channels and dries up others.  Another long-term impact of beaver dams is on soils.  Waterlogged soils in the newly formed wetland areas are anaerobic; that is, they do not contain oxygen. This changes the community of soil bacteria and fungi, as well as the nutrients that are in the soil.  As a result of these changes in soil chemistry, wetland meadows that form from beaver ponds are important places for long-term carbon sequestration. This is a process in which carbon dioxide that has been removed from the atmosphere by plants gets locked deep in the soil in a more stable, solid form.  In this way, beaver-engineered landscapes can have important benefits for climate change.  What began as a beaver dam has now created a complex patchwork of new habitats: ponds, streams, marshes, and meadows that are filled with soil, plant, and animal life that was not present before.\n\nThe original beaver dam starts a long chain of events that change the flow of the stream, and alter the ecosystem along the stream banks – the riparian zone. Because they can impact water flow, beavers historically were considered pests because humans wanted to control the flow of the stream.  Today we recognize that they are not just dam-builders; they are “ecosystem engineers” that can shape entire landscapes. In fact, they are so important that some biologists have begun enlisting their help in restoring damaged stream and wetland habitats."}, {"Source": "forest tree", "Application": "water retention", "Function1": "draw water", "Function2": "water cycle", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaf-pores-draw-water-through-plants/", "Strategy": "Leaf Pores Draw Water Through Plants\n\nPores in leaves allow water to escape as vapor, drawing more water up through the plant from the roots.\n\n\nForest trees play a major role in influencing the flow of water resources. Trees, like most plants, undergo a process called transpiration. This is where water taken up from the roots moves through the plant to be utilized for photosynthesis in the leaves. The water is then released from the leaves into the air as water vapor.\n\nThis process has not only an effect on trees as individuals, but when compounded across an entire forest, it has an impact on the water retention of the ecosystem as a whole.\n\nIn forests with a large amount of trees, the effects of this process are readily seen in the changes in streamflow and soil water. For example, harvesting or cutting down forests substantially increases streamflow because fewer trees are able to draw up and cycle the water back into the atmosphere.\n\nForests with different types of trees vary in their capacity for water interception and transpiration. Deciduous trees are species that shed their leaves when conditions are unfavorable (such as too cold, not enough water, etc.). Since the transpiration process occurs through the trees’ leaves, deciduous trees transpire much less during their dormant seasons. This means that deciduous trees such as oak, maple, and hickory allow more rain to seep into the soil (rather than into roots and through the leaves into the air) and eventually flow downstream. In contrast, evergreen trees (like pines) retain their leaves year-round, and have been shown to have higher annual evapotranspiration (combining transpiration through plants and evaporation from the soil) and therefore reduce streamflows.\n\nDeciduous trees play an important role in ecosystem maintenance by seasonally generating higher water yields. This increase in soil water and streamflow provides a valuable resource to the community. The higher flow can help fill storage reservoirs and mitigate water shortages during drought seasons. Thus, in municipal watersheds and other areas where water resources are of concern, it is important to consider the effects of forest conversion. If forests are converted from deciduous trees to evergreen trees, then local communities will surely see some form of water yield reduction."}, {"Source": "maize root", "Application": "natural pesticide", "Function1": "promote health", "Function2": "prevent the growth of phytopathogens", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/roots-recruit-symbiotic-soil-bacteria/", "Strategy": "Roots Recruit Symbiotic Soil Bacteria\n\nThe roots of maize defend against phytopathogens by releasing a pesticide that also attracts a beneficial microbe that preys on the target pest.\n\n\nIntroduction \n\nPlant roots are surrounded by tens of thousands of species of microbes that collectively make up what is called the rhizosphere. Some of these microbes are phytopathogens that have damaging effects on plants. Others benefit the plant through promoting nutrient uptake, nitrogen fixation, and pathogenic defense systems.

Early stage maize seedlings are especially vulnerable to harm from phytopathogens.\n\nThey have long been known to secrete a chemical called DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-2H-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one) from their roots.

It’s called commensalism, where the plant gets nothing from the other species but provides them living space and the moisture within it. The other species probably also get some resources from the ants. Scientists found 50 species living on Hydnophytum moseleyanum, all using the swollen stem. Eleven of those species were ants and the most common were from the genus Philidris, which has the mutualistic relationship with the ant-plant.\n\nThe other 39 species include, for example, cockroaches, termites, springtails, sow bugs, crickets, silverfishes, wasps, and even a few crabs and lizards.

This is known as a mutualistic relationship, where two or more species work together to provide what the other needs. The ant aggressively defends the acacia from plant-eating insects, neighboring plants, and disease-causing microorganisms. The acacia provides the ant with plenty of food and a place to live and raise its young.\n\nThe bullhorn acacia has odd-looking thorns that look like bull horns. The tiny ants cut entrance holes into the thorns, and that’s where they care for their eggs and larvae. In three years, the population of ants can grow from the lone queen ant laying her first eggs to a tree teeming with 16,000 worker ants. The thorns are waterproof and hold in moisture, which protects the eggs and larvae during dry periods. Their sharp tips keep birds from going after the eggs inside.\n\nIn addition to providing housing, the acacia  provides food in the form of nectar from special glands. The nectar is a thick syrup full of sugars. Even more valuable to the ants are tiny sacs full of proteins, fatty nutrients, and vitamins called Beltian bodies that grow on the end of acacia leaves. The ants   feed these Beltian bodies to their larvae. These two food sources provide most of the food for the ants.\n\nSo what does the ant do for the acacia? The fast and agile worker ants race around the tree defending it from plant-eaters such as insects (including other ants) and larger animals like rodents. The ant that finds an invader sends out an odor alarm that causes other ants to attack it. The ants kill any foreign plants, such as vines, that touch the trees. They also aggressively kill any vegetation growing around the base of the tree. Because of this, the acacia does not have to compete for soil nutrients, water, and sunlight with other trees. Recently, scientists have also discovered that the ants also spread bacteria from their feet onto the acacia leaves. These bacteria can kill fungi and other disease-carrying bacteria that have infected the leaves.\n\nMutualistic relationships like this evolve over millions of generations. The relationship helps both the tree and ant survive difficult times like droughts. In human societies, we know that acting alone is less effective than finding ways to work together by sharing resources and ideas. The acacia and the ant have it figured out by meeting each other’s needs in just the right ways."}, {"Source": "savannah", "Application": "agroforestry", "Function1": "functional stability", "Function2": "resilient", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ecosystems-have-stability-and-resiliency/", "Strategy": "Ecosystems Have Stability and Resiliency\n\nSavannahs have functional stability and resiliency due to unique properties of species and their interaction at system level.\n\n\n“Knoop and Walker (1985) attributed the remarkable functional stability and resilience (ability to recover from change) of savannahs to unique properties of species and their interaction at system level.

It is this opportunity for agroforests to mimic the interactions between trees and other plants in natural ecosystems that led to the recent redefinition of agroforestry (Leakey, 1996), in which different agroforestry practices are viewed as stages in the development of an agroecological succession akin to the dynamics of natural ecosystems. Over time, the increasing integration of trees into land use systems through agroforestry can be seen as the passage towards a mature agroforest of increasing integrity. Similarly, with increasing scale, the integration of various agroforestry practices into the landscape is like the formation of a complex mosaic of patches in an ecosystem, each of which is composed of many niches. These niches are occupied by different organisms, making the system ecologically stable and biologically diverse (Leakey, 1996). In systems like this, the physiological interactions between the tree and crop components of the agroecosystem are more likely to mimic those of natural ecosystems.”"}, {"Source": "bee's antennae", "Application": "design inspired by bees", "Function1": "sense signals", "Function2": "detect movement and vibration", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/antennae-detect-a-variety-of-signals/", "Strategy": "Antennae Detect a Variety of Signals\n\nThe antennae of a bee allows it to sense a variety of signals including chemicals, light, vibrations, and electric fields. \n\n\nThe antennae of  bees serve the same purpose as a nose in humans; they’re filled with receptors for chemical odorants in the environment and help the bee smell the world.\n\nThe antennae of male bees are often much longer than their female counterparts.

This implies that the greater the number of crop species the more assured one would be of achieving a harvest. This is consistent with the practices of subsistence farmers. A more assured income is also a prerequisite for a commitment to expenditure associated with maintaining landscape level ecosystem services.

When they need to get rid of the excess heat, the penguins leave the huddle in an abrupt breakup.

These biological and physical processes interact with many other factors, such as temperature and land structure, to affect a wetland’s overall function.\n\nFor instance, dense communities of wetland plants slow down water flow, which gives more time for solid particles to settle out and nutrients to be consumed by plants and bacteria. In addition, the leaves, stems, and roots of wetland plants provide a large surface area on which bacteria and other microbes can attach. Certain wetland bacteria consume nitrate (an ion containing nitrogen) in the water and convert it into nitrogen gas, which is released into the atmosphere. This process of denitrification tends to be the way that most nitrogen is removed from the water in wetlands.

Low predator–prey biomass ratios in these omnivorous loops were shown to have a crucial role in preserving stability as productivity and complexity increased during succession. Our results show the build-up of food-web complexity in natural productivity gradients and pin down the feedback loops that govern the stability of whole webs.

Then each scout returns to the swarm and communicates how promising the site it visited is by performing a “waggle dance.” In a waggle dance, a bee shakes or vibrates while walking forward in a wave pattern, then circles back and repeats the process. The faster a bee vibrates, the more promising it thinks the site it explored is. At the same time, the orientation of the bee’s movements conveys the newly proposed hive’s direction, and the time or linear distance over which the bee waggles in each cycle conveys the distance to the new hive.

If an area becomes infected, the tissue around it swells and certain cells called macrophages rush to the scene to attack the infection.\n\nMacrophages can attack an infection in different ways. For example, some attack with full strength while some attack less intensely. How a macrophage responds depends on several things. First, individual macrophages communicate with one another to determine how many of them are at an infected site. The more macrophages there are, the more they attack at full strength. Also, if the macrophages have fought the microbe before, a higher number of them will attack at full strength.

Trees, like most plants, undergo a process called evapotranspiration. This is where water taken up from the roots moves through the plant to be utilized for photosynthesis in the leaves. The water is then released from the leaves into the air as water vapor. In forests with a large amount of trees, the effects of this process are readily seen in the changes in streamflow and soil water. For example, harvesting or cutting down forests substantially increases streamflow because fewer trees are able to draw up and cycle the water back into the atmosphere.\n\nForests with different types of trees vary in their capacity for water interception and transpiration. Deciduous trees are species that shed their leaves when conditions are unfavorable (such as too cold, not enough water, etc.). Since the evapotranspiration process occurs through the trees’ leaves, deciduous trees transpire much less during their dormant seasons. This means that deciduous trees such as oak, maple, and hickory allow more rain to seep into the soil (rather than into roots and through the leaves into the air) and eventually flow downstream. In contrast, evergreen trees (like pines) retain their leaves year-round, and have been shown to have higher annual evapotranspiration and therefore reduce streamflows.\n\nDeciduous trees play an important role in ecosystem maintenance by seasonally generating higher water yields. This increase in soil water and streamflow provides a valuable resource to the community. The higher flow can help fill storage reservoirs and mitigate water shortages during drought seasons. Thus, in municipal watersheds and other areas where water resources are of concern, it is important to consider the effects of forest conversion.

The change of form from solid pillar to hollow cylinder alters the way in which the trunk reacts to mechanical stress. It is much more resilient and stable. The removal of many tons of timber also reduces the strain on the tree’s elderly and doubtless somewhat decayed root system. The result is that an old hollow tree is often able to withstand a gale better than a younger undecayed one. In the ancient hunting parks of England such as Windsor, where trees stand out in the open, unprotected by others from the wind, it is by no means rare after a storm to discover that hollow oaks, four or five hundred years old, remain upright when younger ones, a quarter their age, have been blown over.

Biological legacies are species, patterns, or structures that persist within a disturbed area and act as sources of ecosystem recovery, such as large living and dead trees or tree clusters that provide seeds, buried rhizomes or roots, and nutrients to the regenerating stand (Franklin and MacMahon 2000). In some cases these legacies may be biased towards structures or patches that are more likely to survive the disturbance, such as wet or low-lying sites during forest fires. Mobile links are ‘keystone’ organisms that move between habitats and ecosystems after a disturbance to provide essential ecosystem processes that are lacking, such as pollination, seed dispersal, or nutrient translocation, by connecting areas that may be widely separated spatially or temporally (Lundberg and Moberg 2003). Support areas refer to landscape patches or habitats that maintain viable populations of mobile links (Lundberg and Moberg 2003).

The build-up of ecological memory in the form of biological legacies and species in the mosaic landscape usually takes several forest generations during which the soil is formed and nutrient pools and decomposer organisms are accumulated. Although it is common to characterize forest types by particular disturbance regimes, most forests are affected by various disturbances acting at different temporal and spatial scales (Fig. 3; 70-73). Organisms in natural forests have adapted, over evolutionary time, to the characteristic disturbance regimes of these forests.

It’s not always easy coming to a decision, because not everyone in the group always feels like doing the same thing. Sometimes, a really outgoing member of the group convinces just a few other members to do something, and the rest of the group goes along. But other times, especially when the outgoing members of the group are kind of quiet, it can take a while for enough people in the group to finally agree on something.\n\nWell, as it turns out, it’s similar with African wild dogs. African wild dogs live across sub-Saharan Africa in savannas and arid areas, in packs containing pups, juveniles and adults, led by a dominant male and female adult. Dominant individuals control many things in the pack, including mating and the care of pups. But when it comes to making decisions about leaving a resting area — to go on a hunt, for example — decision-making is a little more flexible.\n \nThe Strategy \n\nAfrican wild dogs decide whether to stay or go by voting. They don’t vote by casting a ballot, or raising a hand (paw?), but instead vote using a sound, an abrupt exhale, a little like a sneeze. How many votes it takes to decide to go depends on who starts the sneezing. If a dominant individual sneezes first, then it only takes a few more sneezes by the rest of the dogs for the group to rally and go. If a different (non-dominant) individual sneezes first, the group can still decide to go, but it takes many more sneezes by other group members to make this happen.\n\nThe Potential \n\nSome flexibility in decision-making processes can be useful. Even when a group has leaders, leaders may not always take action, or they may not understand what the rest of the group really needs or wants. Flexibility allows leaders to be overruled when enough other members of a group agree on a different course of action."}, {"Source": "forests of the pacific northwest", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "provide water and nutrients", "Function2": "support seedlings", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nurse-logs-provide-new-habitat/", "Strategy": "Nurse Logs Provide New Habitat\n\nTall, wide trees in the forests of the Pacific Northwest serve as nurse logs to their seedlings after they fall, providing decades of water and nutrients as they slowly decay.\n\n\n“In the coniferous forests of the north-west coast of America, the trees – Sitka spruce, hemlock and Douglas fir – may grow over two hundred feet high and they cut out most of the light.

The girth of an adult tree is such that the upper side of a fallen trunk remains above the ferns. A seed from a neighbouring tree that lands on it can thus get sufficient light to germinate. Being perched there brings another advantage: the bark of the prostrate tree is very fibrous and holds moisture like a sponge to the young plant does not lack for water. As the seedling sprouts, it sends down roots. They grow over the flank of the log and down into the rich soil beneath. As they gain strength, these roots thicken. While they are doing so, fungi are feasting in the wood of the log. Slowly it rots and begins to crumble away providing more sustenance for the young trees.

The top 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters) of soil contains billions of organisms that are always interacting. This complex underground community creates and maintains the substance that plants, trees, and animals depend on.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nA cubic meter of soil may contain thousands of different species of bacteria and fungi; single-celled protists and microscopic nematodes (roundworms); and larger animals such as mites, springtails, earthworms, ants, termites, lice, and beetles. Each species takes part in breaking down leaves, twigs, fruit, animal carcasses, and feces and recycling them into smaller organic materials that plants use to live and grow. And each species has specific abilities that take advantage of different niches in the environment.The largest decomposers are earthworms, ants, termites, millipedes, woodlice, and beetles. They play a crucial role, creating tunnels through which air and water seep into the soil.\n\nSlightly smaller animals such as mites and springtails occupy air-filled pores within soil. They, too, are arthropods––closely related to, but distinct from, insects. They also help decompose organic material and graze on bacteria.\n\nWoven into and around plant roots are fungi, in a relationship that benefits both. The fungi grow out in long narrow tendrils that extend the plants’ root systems deep into and across the soil and give plants more access to minerals they need to grow. The fungi also provide a sheath that protects plants from pathogens and toxic metals. In exchange, the fungi receive sugars that the plants make via photosynthesis.\n\nNematodes and protists living in water in the soil eat organic material and excrete it in particles that are smaller and/or more easily absorbed by roots. Nematodes also eat bacteria, keeping their populations in balance.\n\nThose bacteria have diverse roles to play as well. Some species convert gaseous nitrogen into solid nitrates that plants take up for essential chemical functions. Others specialize in decomposing tough, slow-rotting molecules like cellulose that plants produce to keep stiff and strong.\n\nThe Potential\n\nPeople have learned the hard way that radically changing the landscape above ground can have dire impacts on the underground ecosystem, turning vital soil into infertile dust. Herbicides and insecticides take out segments of the interconnected community that recycle and replenish the soil. Farming and clearcutting forests cut the supplies to underground species. Heavy equipment compacts soil too much for air and water to penetrate. Understanding, maintaining, and working in harmony with the diverse community in the soil holds great potential for helping us to manage our activities on the land more sustainably.\n\nIn addition, learning the intricacies of how different organisms break down waste can lead to more effective and eco-friendly waste treatment systems."}, {"Source": "banksia plant's two-valved seed capsule", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "dispersal of seeds", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fire-opens-seed-capsules/", "Strategy": "Fire Opens Seed Capsules\n\nSeeds of Banksia plants are dispersed via two-valved seed capsules that open in high fire temperatures.\n\n\n“Banksias are spectacular evergreen bushes and trees related to the proteas of South Africa but, with the exception of one whose range extends into the Pacific, they are totally restricted to Australia.

Even though the water itself can damage a house, it’s likely less damaging than the fire. A similar logic pertains to our immune system. Our immune system protects us through physical and chemical means, but in the process, it can also damage our own tissues by attacking our own cells. How does our immune system apply enough defense to take care of an injury or infection, but not so much that it might hurt or even kill us in the process?\n\nWhen we get injured, our body can become infected with foreign microbes. For example, if you fall on the ground after scraping your knee, microbes can enter your body through the open wound. This is why it’s important to keep wounds clean. If an area becomes infected, the tissue around it swells and certain cells called macrophages rush to the scene to attack the infection.\n\nMacrophages can attack an infection in different ways. For example, some attack with full strength while some attack less intensely. How a macrophage responds depends on several things. First, individual macrophages communicate with one another to determine how many of them are at an infected site. The more macrophages there are, the more they attack at full strength. Also, if the macrophages have fought the microbe before, a higher number of them will attack at full strength. There are always other macrophages nearby that are ready to attack in case the infection suddenly becomes stronger. However, if the wound is small or there are fewer microbes, the macrophages will respond less intensely.\n\nThis coordinated attack on infections by macrophages helps to make sure our immune systems don’t over-react, and that the right number of immune cells are working as hard as they need to in any given situation. The dynamic way our immune cells react to threats can give people ideas for designing response guidelines for all sorts of potentially threatening situations, such as how to evacuate buildings in the case of fire or earthquake."}, {"Source": "social insect colony", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "self-organize", "Function2": "carry out complex group tasks", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/colonies-self-organize/", "Strategy": "Colonies Self‑organize\n\nColonies of social insects self-organize and carry out complex group tasks through many simple individual interactions.\n\n\nFor social insects, teamwork is predominantly self-organized. Coordinated primarily through the interactions of individual colony members, the insects can solve complex problems even though each interaction may be very simple.\n\nTo understand the power of self-organization, consider how ants find the shortest distance to a food source simply by laying and following chemical trails. For example, two ants leave their nest in search of food and venture off on separate paths. While walking, they release a trail of pheromones (chemicals) that the other ants in the colony can detect. The ant that takes the shorter route doubles back to the nest more quickly, adding more pheromones on top of those already left on the first passage (away from the nest). This reinforcement of pheromones leaves a higher concentration for other ants to sense, and as a result, other members of the colony detect and follow this more distinct trail of pheromones, as well.\n\nIn the same way, some termites, with no supervision, collectively build above-ground mounds that may facilitate gas exchange with their below-ground nests. Although science has yet to fully explain the exact mechanisms through which these mounds are created, several models indicate that termites are more likely to deposit soil particles where other individuals have just placed particles, due to the presence of short-lived pheromones.\n\nSelf-organization enables a swarm of social insects to carry out complex tasks through the collective duties of individuals within the colony without being centrally controlled.

The relationship between fruiting trees and fruit-eating animals is called a mutualism because both parties benefit. Animals need the nourishment in the nutrient-packed pulp and seeds, and the plant needs to have its seeds carried to new sites, perhaps gaps in vegetation where seedlings stand a better chance of surviving…This service is valuable enough that 50 to 90 percent of the canopy trees and almost all shrubs and smaller trees in the tropical forests of Central and South America bear fruits that are fleshy, brightly colored, or otherwise attract animals. The brilliant red-coated fruits of the tree Casearia corymbosa provide an example of this type of keystone mutualism. During a critical period each December when fruit is otherwise scarce in the forest, these fruits sustain twenty-two species of birds, including cotingas, toucans, parrots, and robin-sized tityras. If Casearia trees were to disappear from the La Selva biological preserve in eastern Costa Rica, Henry Howe of the University of Iowa predicts the loss would lead to the disappearance not only of masked tityras–the only birds that reliably spread the Casearia‘s seeds far and wide–but also of toucans. The toucans need Casearia to sustain them through December’s scarcity, but by January they move on to other preferred fruits, ranging widely and scattering the seeds of a number of plants, including nutmegs. Thus the loss of Casearia, especially from a patch of forest isolated amid a landscape of agricultural fields and grasslands, could precipitate a slow-moving wave of extinctions among an array of forest species.” "}, {"Source": "fungus-growing ant's fungi garden", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "produce constantly changing antibiotics", "Function2": "protect the fungi from outside threats", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bacteria-on-fungus-farming-ants-produce-antibiotics/", "Strategy": "Bacteria on Fungus Farming\nAnts Produce Antibiotics\n\nBacteria growing on ants produce constantly changing antibiotics that invading fungi cannot develop resistance to.\n\n\nIn nature, species work with each other to build long-lasting relationships. One example is the relationship between a  fungus-growing ant,  fungi, and bacteria. Fungus-growing ants grow a garden of fungi. The ants provide the fungi with food and an ideal habitat to grow, and in turn the fungus is a food source for the ants. Special bacteria living on the ants help protect the fungi from outside threats, such as other invading fungi. This three-way relationship is mutually beneficial. This means that two or more species work together to help each other and that the relationship has a positive benefit for everyone.\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves?\n\nFrom time to time, bad fungi will try to invade the ant’s fungi garden. However, the ants cannot eat these fungi, so they would not benefit. Two species of bacteria live on the ant and receive food from the ant. In turn, they make a variety of antibiotic compounds that can stop the growth of these bad fungi. The bacteria can make a variety of different antibiotics by using different parts of their DNA. DNA provides instructions that tells the cells what kinds of compounds to make. The bacteria constantly use different parts of the instructions so that the antibiotic is always different. As a result, the bad fungi cannot develop a defense fast enough. To visualize this, imagine that the bad fungi need to produce a perfect key to open the gate to the ant’s fungi garden. To stop this from happening, the bacteria only need to make small changes to the key slot to stop the bad fungi from opening the gate. As a result, the bad fungi are rarely able to develop a defense against the antibiotics.\n\nHumans can develop infections caused by bacteria. To treat the infections, doctors give antibiotics consisting of only one compound to kill the bacteria. Over time, the bacteria can learn to protect themselves and become resistant to the antibiotic. Therefore, humans could apply fungus-farming ant’s strategy by making small changes to the antibiotics that will make it more difficult for the bacteria to develop resistance."}, {"Source": "brazil nut seed pod", "Application": "lightweight materials for transport containers", "Function1": "protect from cracking", "Function2": "absorb energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/the-toughest-nuts-to-crack/", "Strategy": "The Toughest Nuts to Crack\n\nBrazil nut seed pods hurtle down from tall treetops, but their complex structure deters them from cracking open. \n\nIntroduction\n\nPeople foraging for Brazil nuts in Amazon forests know they should always wear hard hats. The trees can reach 164 feet (50 meters) high. The nuts are encased in hard-shelled spherical pods roughly 6 inches (15 centimeters) in diameter that can weigh up to 5 pounds (2 kilograms). When those pods drop, they hurtle down like cannonballs at speeds of 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) and could easily smash your skull.\n\nBut the pods themselves don’t smash open. If they did, the nuts, or seeds, wouldn’t end up far from the parent tree. Brazil nut pods are built to ensure that they are dispersed by the one animal that can crack them open: the agouti. This guinea pig-like rodent has chisel-shaped teeth and muscular jaws. The pods are densely packed with up to two dozen nuts—more than an agouti can eat at once. So the provisioning critter will carry some away and bury them to eat later. The nuts the agoutis never come back for can take root and grow into trees.\n\nThat explains why Brazil nut pods are built so tough. But figuring out exactly how the pods can withstand such impacts has been a much harder nut to crack.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe secret to the pod shell’s impact resistance is a layer of material about half an inch (1 centimeter) thick, called the mesocarp. Only recently have scientists begun to take a microscopic look at this layer. Their research reveals that it is a multilayered amalgam of different-shaped cells and empty spaces—all arranged in a complex pattern that absorbs shocks and resists cracking.\n\nThe mesocarp contains two types of cells, both with thick walls made of lignin, a strong polymer that gives plant stems their rigidity. First, there are elongated cells, organized like cables into strong, elastic fiber bundles. They are arranged in three layers. The two on the outside point in the same direction. Sandwiched in the middle is a bigger layer, oriented perpendicular to both.\n\nFilling in most of the spaces between these bundles are spherical husks of dead cells called sclereids. Their centers are hollow, but their lignin walls are tough. This mesh of cells also has occasional voids—remnants of circulatory channels that transported water and nutrients to the fruit when it was growing. Using hollow or dead cells is a common strategy in nature that simultaneously helps optimize strength, stiffness, and weight.\n\nWhen the pod smashes against the ground, the hollow sclereid cells compress, but don’t break apart. That absorbs a lot of shock, similar to the way foam does inside car bumpers.\n\nThe toughness of the lignin fibers resists cracking, but any cracks that do form in the outer layers stop when they hit the wall of perpendicular fibers in the middle layer.\n\nThe empty channels help in two ways. First, they provide spaces for cells to compress or slide into, dissipating some energy from impacts. Then, they offer paths of lesser resistance, directing energy along them and away from the fibers. Altogether, the mesocarp works to absorb energy from impact and create spiderweb-like networks of little tears that don’t converge into gaping cracks.\n\nThe Potential \n\nBrazil nut pods offer an excellent model for fracture-resistant materials. Studying how the sizes, shapes, distribution, and orientation of cells in the mesocarp prevent cracking can inspire lightweight materials for transport containers, packaging, helmets and other protective gear, and devices to shield vehicles and buildings against impacts."}, {"Source": "coconut palm's seed", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "survive long sea voyages", "Function2": "enclosed in nutrient-rich, water-filled protective shells", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/seeds-survive-long-sea-voyages/", "Strategy": "Seeds Survive Long Sea Voyages\n\nThe seeds of coconut palms survive long sea voyages because they are enclosed in nutrient-rich, water-filled protective shells.\n\n“Some trees send their seeds, not by air, but by sea.

Some species of mangrove, however, manage to plant their offspring with as much firmness as a gardener armed with a dibble. The seeds germinate while they are still attached to their parent. A long green spike develops that hangs vertically downwards. In some species it may measure as much as two feet. Eventually, it falls. If the tide is out, it may stab straight into the soft mud. Tiny rootlets then grow out from its flanks with great speed and within hours the young seedling may have established itself firmly enough to resist the swill of the returning tide…If the tide happens to be in when the seedling falls, then instead of rooting immediately, it travels. That may be riskier, for it may be swept out to sea and lost altogether. But potentially it is more beneficial for the species as a whole, for the youngster is taken away from its natal swamp where it would be competing with its parent and ferried to territory that may not yet have been colonised by mangroves. At first, it hangs vertically in the brackish water. But if it is carried beyond the estuary then the water becomes saltier and more buoyant so that the seedling begins to float horizontally. That may save its life. If the tender terminal bud, from which leaves will spring in due course, were exposed, unshaded in the tropical sun, it could easily over-heat, even scorch. Floating horizontally, however, it is continually lapped by water and kept cool. The flank of the long root benefits from being exposed along its length for it is green with chlorophyll and is able to photosynthesize. The food it manufactures keeps the whole root alive and growing and it can survive floating at sea for months. If eventually the capricious tides do carry it to another brackish estuary, then the buoyancy of the water is reduced and the young mangrove once again hangs vertically, ready to catch on the bottom of shallows which might be a suitable place to grow.”"}, {"Source": "frog skin", "Application": "alternative antifungal drugs", "Function1": "stop fungi growth", "Function2": "inhibit fungal infections", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bacteria-on-frog-skin-releases-anti-fungal-compounds/", "Strategy": "Bacteria on Frog Skin Releases\nAnti‑fungal Compounds\n\nLipoproteins released by bacteria on frog skin protects frogs from fungal disease.\n\n\nFrogs live in humid environments such as tropical forests. Because of the high humidity, there is a lot of water in the air, and this helps fungi to grow more easily. Fungi can infect frogs and cause infections, similar to how humans can get fungal infections such as ‘Athlete’s Foot’. Some frog species are on the decline or have become extinct as a result of fungal infections. However, certain frog species have developed a defense against these fungi. Bacteria living on the skin of frogs of the Anuran family in Panama release compounds that protect the frogs from fungi. One specific compound, viscosin, can stop fungi growth.\n\nViscosin belongs to a class of compounds called lipopeptides. Lipopeptides are compounds made by different types of bacteria that can kill other bacteria by creating holes in their cell membrane. The cell membrane protects the cell from the outside environment and only allows certain molecules to pass through. For example, the flow of potassium ions into and out of the cell is maintained by the membrane and must be very tightly controlled. If a hole is created in the membrane, the cell can lose or gain more of an ion from the environment, causing an imbalance. As a result, the cells will die.\n\nScientists have recently shown that viscosin can also inhibit fungal infections. A major difference between bacteria and fungi is their cell wall. Gram-negative bacteria are a type of bacteria that make up the majority of infections. They have an outer membrane and an inner membrane. In contrast, a fungus cell has an outer wall made up of sugar proteins and chitin, and an inner membrane. Chitin is a strong material that protects the fungi cells and is much stronger compared to the bacterial membrane. Scientists think that viscosin works by breaking down chitin to disrupt fungus cell function, similar to bacteria. This has not been studied before and may lead to a new understanding of how different compounds kill fungi cells.\n\nResearchers have been working to discover new antifungal medicine because certain types of fungi cannot be killed using current medicines.

In monocultures, there is no biodiversity. This is an issue because a monoculture crop provides an abundant supply of food to a pest that favors it, and the pest can easily reproduce and travel between plants. In order to suppress pests, agriculturalists often use pesticides that damage the environment. Man-made pesticides are typically chemicals that kill other plants or pests along with beneficial organisms, such as bees and soil microbes.\n\nHealthy ecosystems usually have a large variety of species. An area that consists of many plant, animal, and microbe species is an area with high biodiversity. Species living in that area can provide important services to each other. Pest control is an example of a service a plant can provide to another plant. In agriculture, companion planting, or planting at least two crops in the same field, can be used as a way to help control pests.\n\nAn example of companion planting is planting  tomatoes with marigolds. In a field where only tomatoes are grown, whiteflies are a common pest that can destroy the crop. Long ago farmers solved this problem by planting marigolds next to tomato plants. They believed that doing so protected the tomato plants from whiteflies. Recently, scientists confirmed that whitefly populations were smaller when tomatoes were planted with marigold flowers. They’ve identified that limonene, a chemical substance found in marigolds, is the substance that repels whiteflies. Limonene belongs to a group of chemical substances called volatile plant compounds (VPCs). VPCs are emitted by plants to send signals to other plants or to attract or repel insects. An insect’s antennae or other sensory organs detect the VPCs, just as a human nose detects many chemical compounds. VPCs can be isolated from a plant. The isolated substances can then be sprayed or emitted to repel pests. However, in the case of tomatoes, planting marigolds directly can provide more benefits than using the isolated limonene VPC. It also increases biodiversity and provides nectar for bees.\n\nIn nature, distinct VPCs are emitted by different plants. Together, these plants can repel different insect species and provide a safe method for pest control. This suggests that a careful mix of plantings could repel all sorts of pests. Scientists have much more to learn from natural systems regarding methods of pest control. Those lessons should guide scientists towards effective and safe pest control and could reduce or eliminate the need for man-made pesticides.\""}, {"Source": "e. coli", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "maintain stable relationship", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/circular-competition-benefits-community/", "Strategy": "Circular Competition Benefits Community\n\nCircular competition among three strains of E. coli helps maintain a stable community.\n\n\nIntroduction \n\nIn nature, competition usually means dominant species exclude others. If species are to keep from wiping each other out, they need to have something that helps to equalize them. One option is to specialize in a particular resource, such as a type of food, that their competition doesn’t eat. Another way is to have a relationship where each organism can restrict the other in some way to ensure that no one organism takes over. This is known as a rock-paper-scissors relationship.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nIn the children’s game of rock-paper-scissors, rock smashes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. There can always be different winners and losers, but no one person can win outright every time. Scientists have found species in nature that also compete this way, including some lizards and plants. One example involves three strains of the bacteria E. coli that scientists have nicknamed C, S, and R (see illustration).\n\nEach has its own strengths but also its own weaknesses. C (rock) produces a toxin (called colicin, hence the nickname C) that can kill S (scissors). However, producing that toxin slows the growth of C. R (paper) is resistant to the toxin and grows faster than C, taking over its area. S (scissors) can outgrow R but is sensitive to the toxin.\nThese strains can exist together as long as they live in patches where there is space to grow uninhibited by the others.

Each cone is composed of many tightly fitting, polygonal scales attached to a central axis (Figure 66). On the inner surface of the scale are several oblong yellowish sporangia filled with green, photosynthetic spores. When the spores are ripe, the central axis of the cone elongates, separating the scales and exposing the sporangia to the air. Upon drying, the sporangia split lengthwise and release the spores, allowing them to be carried away by air currents. The spores are helped on their journey by four strap-like structures called elaters that catch the wind. The elaters coil and uncoil in response to changes in humidity. When the air is dry they extend outward and create wind resistance so that the spores float (Figure 67). When the air is humid the elaters coil around the spore so that buoyancy decreases and the spore drops–with luck onto moist soil where it can germinate.

The silken nodules project 2–3 mm into the sand beyond the burrow wall, corresponding to about 10% of the spider’s body length. A progression of nodule rings runs along the length of the burrow wall (Henschel, 1990b).

Individual scouts from a colony roam throughout an area near the nest in order to identify other potential nest sites that might be better than the existing one. If a better nest site is found, the entire colony will move to it. Rock ants determine if a potential nest site is superior based on how many scouts gather at the new potential site. If the number of scouts reaches a certain threshold, they will return to the colony and start moving  to the new site.\n\nWhat determines whether a new site is better than the old one? Ants will look for a number of features, but they usually prefer nest sites that are darker because it offers more protection from harmful weather.  If a new site is darker than the old one, it is relatively easy for ants to decide to make the switch. But what happens when the choice is less obvious? For example, a new site that’s under a tree might be completely dark for 75% of the time on a windy day, and light only 25% of the time. If the old nest site is only moderately dark 100% of the time, how do the ants decide whether to switch sites or not?\n\nThe question is similar to deciding where to go to dinner based on how many people are in two different restaurants. It makes sense to go to the fuller restaurant. But what if you know that one restaurant serves consistently mediocre food, while the other varies in quality between better-than-mediocre and worse? How does one decide then?\n\nRock ants are able to navigate this difficult situation by determining the average quality of a new nest site. If a new nest site is of good quality 75% of the time and poor 25% of the time, they will transfer from an old nest site that is consistently (100%) of mediocre quality. However, if a new nest site is of poor quality 75% of the time and good only 25% of the time, they won’t move. Rock ants are able to calculate the average quality of a variable nest site because more scouts eventually spend more time in nest sites that are of higher quality. Thus, the probability of enough scouts gathering in higher quality sites is greater than in lower quality sites (where scouts leave after shorter periods of time)."}, {"Source": "mountain hemlock forest", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "weed out less fit or vigorous individuals", "Function2": "recycle essential nutrients", "Function3": "influence the mix of species", "Function4": "influence the direction and pace of successional change", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fungal-root-rot-renews-forest/", "Strategy": "Fungal Root‑Rot Renews Forest\n\nFungal root-rot renews mountain hemlock forests by causing nitrogen release.\n\n“Disease outbreaks are certainly part of the natural cycle.

Large populations of predatory fish, such as pike, bass, walleye, and muskellunge in a lake hold down numbers of smaller prey fish such as minnows, which in turn keep algae-eating zooplankton in check. Algal growth, finally, depends on nutrient supplies. When pike are abundant and minnow numbers are reduced, the researchers reasoned, zooplankton thrive and keep the standing stocks of algae lower than the maximum allowed by nutrient levels. The researchers proposed that a change in just one of these links in the food web–for instance, heavy fishing that reduces pike numbers–sends a ripple effect through the system that eventually affects the amount of algae in the lake. Carpenter and James Kitchell, also of Wisconsin, set up a test of this ripple effect, called a trophic cascade, in a series of lakes in Wisconsin. The most dramatic shift came in Tuesday lake, which had no bass but had abundant minnows. The researchers removed 90 percent of the minnows by weight and introduced stocks of largemouth bass from a nearby lake. The abrupt decline in minnows, which had kept the zooplankton numbers low, caused populations of these tiny grazers to expand dramatically and knock down the high densities of algae by 80 to 90 percent.”"}, {"Source": "diatom", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "engineer the environment", "Function2": "stabilize the environment", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/estuaries-rely-on-ecosystem-engineers/", "Strategy": "Estuaries Rely on Ecosystem Engineers\n\nEstuarine ecosystems rely on diatoms because they act as ecosystem engineers by binding sand to stabilize the environment.\n\n“Many organisms modulate the availability of resources to other species by causing state changes in biotic or abiotic materials (ecosystem engineering), in the process frequently changing the selection to which the ecosystem engineers and other organisms are exposed (niche construction)…In the Bay of Fundy, Canada, estuarine sediments are dominated by benthic diatoms that produce carbohydrate exudates. These secretions bind the sand and stabilize its movement, which causes a physical state change in the environment that allows other species to colonize the area (figure 1;Daborn et al. 1993, Jones et al. 1997). An amphipod (Corophium volutator) that grazes on the diatoms affects soil stability; where these amphipods are abundant, sand stabilization by diatoms is reduced. In turn, migratory sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) feed on the amphipods (figure 2). With the appearance of these birds, amphipod numbers decline, promoting restabilization of the habitat by diatoms. Jones and colleagues (1997) point out that the sandpiper might be seen as the keystone species in the system, since it meets keystone definitions, and variation in its abundance has great knock-on effects on the ecosystem. However, these effects transpire only because of the engineering activities of the diatoms, which are the key ecosystem engineers.

The direct connection of impervious surfaces to streams means that even small rainfall events can produce sufficient surface runoff to cause frequent disturbance through regular delivery of water and pollutants; where impervious surfaces are not directly connected to streams, small rainfall events are intercepted and infiltrated. We, therefore, identified use of alternative drainage methods, which maintain a near-natural frequency of surface runoff from the catchment, as the best approach to stream restoration in urban catchments and then used models of relationships between 14 ecological indicators and EI to determine restoration objectives. Ecological condition, as indicated by concentrations of water-quality variables, algal biomass, and several measures of diatom and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, declined with increasing EI until a threshold was reached (EI 0.01–0.14), beyond which no further degradation was observed. We showed, in a sample catchment, that it is possible to redesign the drainage system to reduce EI to a level at which the models predict detectable improvement in most ecological indicators.

Colonies of the mound-building termite (Macrotermes michaelseni) build subterranean nests during prolonged dry periods in seasonally flooded areas (Fig. 5.13). These nests are eventually crowned by a turret connected to the nest by a series of air passages. These turrets or mounds can be 4 m tall and have a basal area of 50 m2 (Dangerfield et al. 1998). Termite colonies redistribute resources by moving fine soil particles to their nests to build up the mound, thus changing the local topography and soil textural properties of the wetland. Termites also carry organic matter to their nests, thus redistributing nutrients locally. Because of their elevation above the floodplain, termite mounds can be colonized by tree species. During the wet season, the termite colonies may be killed. However, any trees on the mounds survive because they are growing above the mean water level. The presence of trees attracts birds and other animals that carry seeds and nutrients to the newly formed island (Fig. 5.13).

As the arrowgrass dies and decomposes, it builds up a pile of nutrient-rich matter atop the roots. The roots continue to spread out around the center, expanding the elevated rings. They can reach up to 2 feet (60 centimeters) high and 6 feet (2 meters) wide.\n\nThe elevated rings provide ground for airborne seeds to settle and also catch seeds that float by.

The arrowgrass plots become tiny isles that provide nutrients and shelter for a variety of plants to flourish.\n\nThe Potential\n\nMost living things evolve abilities to adapt to their environments.

Reindeer, controlling the abundance of lichens, traditionally grazed in a pulsed manner both between years on single sites and regionally on a longer time scale, as reindeer populations waxed and waned on a 30–50 year cycle (89).

Tropical gallery forest, however, occurs naturally as patches within fire-prone savannas. These fragments can represent significant refugia for fire-sensitive species (Kellman et al., 1998). Investigations into how fire-sensitive species persist alongside a fire-prone environment can yield useful information for the management of fire within human-derived forest fragments…Kellman and Meave (1997), Kellman and Tackaberry (1997), Biddulph and Kellman (1998) and Kellman et al. (1998) examine the impact of fire on tropical gallery forest–savanna ecotones in Belize and Venezuela. It was found that fires were mostly prevented from penetrating the gallery forest by changes in fuel characteristics at the forest boundary. The timing of fires was also critical: the savannas tended to burn before the gallery forest fuels were sufficiently cured. In addition, woody species directly adjacent to the savanna were found to be fire adapted. They act as a buffer zone, affording some protection from fire to the fire-sensitive within the gallery forest interior. Kellman and Meave (1997:23) also found that a moderate fire regime can ‘have an enriching, rather than depauperizing effect on the forest communities’ as fire will act in a similar way to that of tree-fall gap dynamics – as a selection agent. They also suggest that if forest fragments are to survive, fire-tolerant species at the forest edge are needed to protect fire-sensitive species within the interior: ‘The most valuable fragments are likely to be those in regions lacking any species pre-adapted to this agent’ (Kellman and Meave, 1997:34).”"}, {"Source": "resource partitioning", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "recover from disturbances", "Function2": "colonize newly created habitats", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ecosystems-recover-from-disturbances/", "Strategy": "Ecosystems Recover From Disturbances\n\nEcosystems recover from disturbances through resource partitioning as resilient species colonize newly created habitats.\n\n“Other species attributes such as ability to cope with disturbances and colonization ability can contribute to successful coexistence of species that otherwise show little resource partitioning.

These small but powerful molecules cause bacteria to self-destruct by disrupting their ability to protect themselves from detrimental forms of oxygen.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nA wide variety of plants, including many of the fruits and vegetables we consume, make THβC alkaloids. They do so by combining amines and aldehydes to form a basic “backbone” structure and adding molecular attachments that serve different functions, much as a vacuum cleaner might have a brush to clean fabric or a crevice tool to reach into tight spaces. Scientists have found that various members of this group of compounds have beneficial impacts such as fighting tumors and reducing inflammation, in addition to providing protection from disease-causing organisms.\n\nTHβC alkaloids share a common basic structure consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen molecules arranged into three rings. Different species use different forms of THβC for different purposes, depending on their needs.\n\nIn plants, some THβC alkaloids have a particularly powerful impact on bacteria. When microbes breach a plant’s cellular barriers, the plant signals the THβC alkaloids to leave their headquarters—most likely a storage room within cells called a vacuole—and attack the invaders.\n\nAlthough the exact mechanisms are unclear, scientists have hypothesized that THβC alkaloids work in part by derailing the cells’ oxygen-defense mechanisms, increasing the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside the microbes. ROS are molecules that include an oxygen atom that reacts readily with other molecules. ROS occur naturally in cells and are essential for proper cell functioning, but at increased levels, the highly reactive oxygen can damage DNA molecules and disrupt essential cellular processes, leading to the death of the cell.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe use of THβC alkaloids to fight certain diseases, especially in fruits and vegetables, opens the door to huge opportunities to craft novel compounds that can be applied to plants to prevent or treat disease.

But one of the traits we share is that we all have holes in our heads. In particular, nostrils or nares allow us to breathe with our mouths shut. In some animals, including seabirds and marine iguanas, they also serve as exit portals for secretions from a gland that concentrates and expels salt.\n\nAs useful as nares are for most birds, for gannets (Morus species), they could spell big trouble. Gannets are fish-eating seabirds that capture their prey by plummeting from a height of up to 100 feet (30 meters) into the ocean. As they hit the water at speeds of around 45 miles per hour (20 meters per second), external nares on the top of the beak would allow the impact to force harmful amounts of water into the mouth, throat, and lungs.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nFortunately for gannets, that’s not an issue. As a gannet embryo develops inside its egg, the spaces that in other species would become nares fill in with bone and keratin, creating a smooth, impenetrable surface.\n\nHow does a gannet breathe without functioning nares? The bony structures that shape the sides of the beak where it meets the head create a slight opening between the top and bottom bill. The bird is then able to inhale and exhale through the sides of its mouth when it’s not diving. The main bone forming this structure, the jugal operculum, is not rigidly attached to the skull. As a result, when the bird hits the surface of the water, the force of impact presses the bone against the top bill, like an automatic shut-off valve, temporarily closing the gap.\n\nThe gannet’s approach to excreting excess salt takes a different path from other birds as well. Instead of exiting through the nares, the fluid travels along a channel at the roof of the gannet’s mouth to the tip of its beak, where the bird expels it.\n\nA bone that creates an outpouching where a cape gannet’s beak meets its face also createsa collapsible gap the bird can use to breathe above water but that shuts down when it dives.\n\nPotential\n\nThe compressible bone structure that allows the gannet to breathe freely through the sides of its beak but that rapidly closes upon the bird’s forceful entry into water can provide a useful model for human-made structures that require different permeabilities to environmental liquids or gases under different circumstances.\n\nExamples might include gannett-inspired valves on aircraft, submersible vehicles used for ocean exploration, and offshore equipment for drilling or harvesting the energy of waves or tides.\n\nThe ability to maintain a separation from external liquids or gases during rapid movement also might inform strategies for creating packaging that allows exchanges with external substances, but only under controlled conditions."}, {"Source": "honeybee", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "improve human collaboration", "Function2": "knowledge sharing", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/collaborating-for-group-decisions/", "Strategy": "Collaborating for Group Decisions\n\nHoneybees collaborate when foraging, selecting a new hive through knowledge sharing.\n\n“Researchers at the Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, led by principal researcher Feniosky Pena-Mora, are looking at ways to improve human collaboration during disaster relief efforts.

Yet, once they’re spun, some webs can survive with minimal repairs for days or even weeks without being destroyed by decomposing organisms like fungi and bacteria. Not only that, but throughout history people have used spider silk to dress wounds, suggesting that they may have antimicrobial super powers. Why aren’t these webs degraded by bacteria and fungi, even though they’re made of microbes’ favorite foods? The answer appears to lie not in chemicals that kill bacteria and fungi, but from the arrangement of the proteins that are one of the main components of spider silk.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe outer layer of spider silk is made up of various proteins and fat molecules. As in other biological materials, the proteins play a big role in how the material is structured. They are composed of hundreds of individual building blocks, called amino acids, strung together like beads on a string. Different amino acids have different traits, as well as positive or negative charges. Opposite charges attract, while similar charges repel each other. These interactions mean that, depending on the kinds and order of amino acids in the chain, different parts of a protein end up organized into different shapes. One of these shapes is known as a helix that contains parts known as beta sheets.This is where spider silk’s microbe-repelling skills appear to come from. Scientists have discovered that some spider silk protein conglomerations called fibroins have beta-sheet sections with similar charges that cause them to repel each other, creating a regular arrangement of hydrophobic (water-repelling) patches across the surface of the silk. These patches effectively prevent microorganisms from finding a place to land and stick—much as a team of skilled volleyball players scattered over a court can keep the ball from hitting the ground anywhere.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe ability of bacteria and fungi to adhere to a surface can cause big problems for humans. In medical settings, microbes can attach to implants and prosthetic devices, giving themselves a chance to multiply and create a colony bigenough to protect itself from antibiotics. In drinking water systems and food preparation settings, such “biofilms” can increase the risk of spreading contamination by giving microbes a place to grow and multiply. By emulating spider silk proteins and their bacteria-repelling arrangement of uncharged beta-sheet sections, humans could create coatings for medical devices and other surfaces that will make it harder for bacteria to stick around and cause trouble."}, {"Source": "moth's tympanal organs", "Application": "hearing aid", "Function1": "hear bat biosonar", "Function2": "avoid oncoming bats", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/how-moths-outwit-bats-with-their-super-hearing/", "Strategy": "How Moths Outwit Bats\nWith Their Super Hearing\n\nThe tympanal organs of moths can \"hear\" bat biosonar and trigger behavioral responses.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlmost all species on Earth fall into the category of predator or prey–some fall into both. A battle of wits determines who wins: the one who needs to eat or the one who needs to not be eaten. Evolution has refined the strategies of insect-eating bats and their moth prey to the point where what was once perceived as an advantage for the bats can be considered their downfall in this case.\n\nInsect-eating bats use biosonar to detect their prey in the air, while moths have evolved the ability to hear bats coming towards them. Exceptional hearing has been useful for reproductive and predator avoidance strategies among nocturnal species. Millions of years of predation pressure from bats on nocturnal flying insects like moths have resulted in their heightened acoustic awareness.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nBats inadvertently warn moths of their approach through their very efforts to locate their prey. They get the information they need about their prey’s location from how and when their biosonar signals are echoed back to them after hitting their target. Moths can successfully avoid oncoming bats in the dark by hearing their chirps before the echoes bounce off the moths and return to the bats.\n\nLow-frequency sound signals are detected by a moth’s receptor hairs, while the tympanal organs detect high-frequency signals. As such, the ultrasonic frequencies of bat biosonar, ranging from 20 to 200 kHz, are detected with the tympanal organs, found in various locations on the body, depending on the family. Most moths can only detect frequencies that cover a portion of the bat’s biosonar range (20 to 50 kHz), but some moths can hear frequencies of over 200 kHz.\n\nSimilar to timpani in an orchestra, the tympanal organs consist of a membrane covering an air sac. The sac in turn is attached to sensory cells that translate the vibrations into a neural signal, which is then processed and triggers the appropriate behavioral response. Tympanal organs are so useful that they have evolved independently across multiple families of moths.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThis kind of frequency-targeted, distributed sound detection could be useful for medical devices such as hearing aids. It could also be useful for sensor development in general, improving security systems on property, collision avoidance for vehicles, or wildlife monitoring.\n\n"}, {"Source": "immune system", "Application": "medical bandage", "Function1": "monitor threats", "Function2": "respond in force", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/how-immune-systems-identify-real-threats/", "Strategy": "How Immune Systems Identify Real Threats\n\nImmune systems constantly monitor threats, but respond in force when there are signs of cell death.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt can be easy to think of your immune system as generally inactive, waiting to spring into action when a major infection comes on, but it is in fact never at rest. Daily, the immune system is assessing the danger of foreign particles: flower pollen, carpet bits you inhale, harmless bacteria on surfaces you touch, and, not infrequently, potentially dangerous microbes.\n\nImmune system responses are costly in terms of energy and while they are of critical importance, they also take a toll on the body. These reactions and overreactions can range from uncomfortable to even dangerous for the host. Which particles should an immune system react to, and which should it ignore? Getting the answer right is literally a matter of life and death.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nMicrobes and chemicals that are a threat to our bodies share a feature that harmless ones do not: they cause cell death. When a cell dies due to an attack, the contents of that cell pour out, flowing into the fluids between other cells. Some of these molecules normally found inside cells and their derivatives then serve a new purpose: they can function as signals, triggering a response from the still healthy cells that comprise our immune system. In this way, an immune system can distinguish between dangerous and non-dangerous microbes, and minimize overreacting to foreign particles that actually are no threat.\n\nFor example, as pathogenic microbes injure and destroy cells inside a mammal, the genetic material in these cells (RNA and DNA) begins to fall apart. Genetic material contains large amounts of a molecule called purine. Liberated from genes, purine loses an electron (oxidizes) to form a new compound, uric acid. Thus, during infection, large amounts of uric acid are produced by cells dying from infection, and that acid pours into the extracellular matrix. This sets off a chain reaction in which the uric acid stimulates dendritic cells to become more numerous and more active. These activated dendritic cells then travel to lymph nodes where they alert immune cells such as T cells that an infection is underway. The T cells then travel to the infection site to attack the pathogenic microbe.\n\nAn immune response to harmless foreign particles would keep the body in a near-constant state of immune activity, use unnecessary energy, and be more susceptible to autoimmune disorders. The “dead cell alert” process helps ensure that the immune system doesn’t become active simply due to the presence of a foreign particle. Foreign matter and evidence of cell death are both needed to trigger an immune response.\n\nThe Potential \n\nKnowing what triggers our immune system response can open up opportunities for moderating that response, such as developing interventions which change the level of triggering molecules in our bodies.

They also defy our expectations of what’s possible, by somehow managing to combine two things that normally don’t go together: activity in high temperatures, and low water use. Another species, Homo sapiens, also can be active under high temperatures, but we do so by sweating copious amounts of water in order to cool our bodies down––quantities of water which camels can’t often afford to lose.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nBecause their fur stays dry to the touch, it used to be believed that camels didn’t sweat at all. That couldn’t be further from the truth. The unique interaction of their sweat and fur is the key to camels keeping cool.\n\nCamels have sweat glands distributed throughout their skin, from which water removes body heat through evaporation, much as in humans. However, camel skin is also covered by thick fur––4 inches (10 cm) deep in places. This fur doesn’t impede the evaporation of water though. What it does do is insulate the camel from incoming heat.\n\nThis insulating power of the camel’s fur reduces the amount of heat transferred to the camel’s body from its hot ambient environment by three main mechanisms. The light color of a camel’s fur reflects light energy, reducing heat transfer to its skin by radiation. The trapped air in the camel’s fur functions as a thin material, with space between the individual molecules, minimizing heat transfer to the skin by conduction. Finally, the individual hairs of the camel’s fur impede the movement of air, reducing heat transfer to its skin by convection.\n\nBetween the outer surface of their fur and their skin, temperatures can vary by as much as 54 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius)––the difference between a summer day and a snow day. As a consequence, camels need to evaporate much less water from their skin in order to cool themselves down. The importance of their fur is emphasized by the fact that camels with shorn fur use much more water than camels with fur intact.\n\nThe Potential\n\nRival elk bulls may have a few bones to pick with each other.

Competitors lock together, pushing each other around like sumo wrestlers. A large set can grow to a combined weight of up to 40 pounds (18 kilograms)––about the weight of an entire newborn calf.\n\nThese heavy crowns don’t fulfill the typical bone functions of supporting body weight or protecting organs. Instead, they’re used for sparring and to display a bull’s vim and vigor to prospective mates.\n\nIn early winter, after the mating rut ends, the antlers fall off. In the spring, the cycle begins again and bulls sprout a new pair of bones from their skulls, growing as fast as an inch per day.\n\nHow does something grown so quickly, with only the materials gained from the elk’s natural diet, withstand repeated, high-impact collisions without breaking?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAntler is one of the toughest known biomaterials. Toughness is resistance to fracture. Strength is resistance to bending. To have one quality generally requires sacrificing some of the other. To achieve balance, elk antlers use the same ingredients as human bone, but the recipe is slightly different. Antlers have fewer hard calcium crystals and higher amounts of pliable collagen, which gives them higher flexibility. This makes antlers much tougher than human bones because they can bend farther before they break. But because they’re more flexible, they are not as strong.\n\nIt’s not just flexibility that helps antler resist fracture. The way its building blocks are organized also helps give it built-in crack resistance. Similar to other kinds of compact bone, the basic components of antlers are cylindrical structures called osteons.\n\nThe Potential\n\nRival elk bulls may have a few bones to pick with each other.

This shape provides protection from the teeth and claws of predators and helps a tortoise to right itself if it happens to roll (or be flipped) onto its back. The surface of a tortoise shell is covered in bony geometrical shapes called scutes that are packed tightly together. The scutes in the center of the shell are hexagons. These are surrounded by a ring of pentagons and irregular shapes, and finally a smooth outer edge of additional irregular shapes. Hexagons are the ideal shape for packing an area tightly with a repeated shape, but they cannot form a curved surface on their own. Pentagons are needed to create a tension-free bend. The range of shapes that fit together to form a tortoise’s curved shell are the result of millions of years of evolution and present a natural solution to the mathematical and physical problem of creating a dome-like structure that is both strong and lightweight.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe scutes are made of keratin, the same protein that is the building block for hair, nails, feathers, and claws. Beneath them is a bone plate. This rigid outer layer prevents the teeth and claws of predators from puncturing the shell, but there’s more to a shell than what is visible on the outside.\n\nThe shell’s durability is largely due to its internal layers. Filling the space below the outer layer is a more sponge-like material that gives the shell some flexibility by absorbing pressure if the shell is pushed down. This inner layer is made of its own sections, separate from the scutes, that interlock with each other through ridges at their edges. These joints give the shell additional room to bend––a critical adaptation since a curved shell is more likely to crack under pressure.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe tortoise shell offers an example of how a combination of shapes and materials can be used to build structures that would normally be vulnerable to breakage.

They breed farther north than any other land bird, nesting in “islands” of tundra called nunataks that poke through surrounding ice.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nLike other animals, birds have evolved an emergency response that shifts their bodies into survival mode during environmental stressors such as severe weather, habitat loss, or famine. The process elevates blood concentrations of corticosterone, a hormone that at high levels can suppress reproduction. The net result is that would-be parents can attend to their own survival needs rather than diverting resources to children.\n\nSome birds however have adapted to suppress this emergency response, keeping lower corticosterone levels in the face of environmental threats. This appears to depend on their “brood value,” or the value of producing offspring relative to their own survival.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, breeding and raising young is the goal of all species, but it comes at a price. For birds, the cost is energy to build a nest, to lay and incubate an egg, and to find food for the chicks once they hatch. In times of stress, all that work may not be worth the risk to the adults’ survival.\n\nLonger-living birds such as arctic terns and great horned owls have more opportunities to breed resulting in lower brood values because their species’ survival isn’t constrained by limited breeding windows. When these birds experience environmental stress, their emergency response functions as expected—corticosterone levels increase and interrupt the normal hormonal changes that transition them through various reproductive stages. They might delay the process of molting and growing their breeding plumage, or may even abandon their duties to existing eggs or chicks. When the stress has passed, these so-called “prudent parents” live to breed another day.\nOther birds like finches and hummingbirds live shorter lives and have fewer occasions to breed. For them, procreation has a high value because the entire species depends on far fewer reproduction events. Some species of birds with high brood values appear to have adapted to suppress corticosterone levels in times of stress, keeping their focus on “the birds and the bees.” In other words, it’s worth the risk for them to expend the energy to breed and care for young because even if they survive the immediate stress, they may not have another opportunity to breed.\n\nThe Potential\n\nMany birds, like the snow bunting, migrate far and wide to breed. With increasing environmental stressors such as habitat loss due to human construction and warming temperatures due to climate change, understanding how birds respond might help us protect their dwindling populations.\n\nFurthermore, it may seem at first glance that birds with higher brood values have overridden a primal evolutionary goal to survive. But nature is driving them to succeed as a species, not just as individuals. It can be beneficial to populations as a whole for some members to act self-sacrificially. And more abstractly, sometimes ignoring or overriding certain instincts for an immediate apparent benefit can bring a broader success to the community or project as a whole in the long term."}, {"Source": "natural ecosystem", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "increase biodiversity", "Function2": "respond to reduced biodiversity", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/nature-maintains-biodiversity/", "Strategy": "Nature Maintains Biodiversity\n\nNatural ecosystems react to low biodiversity levels by exploiting unused or poorly used resources to increase biodiversity.\n\n“In the case of skeleton weed biodiversity was inadvertently increased by the accidental introduction and then deliberately increased in the hope of achieving an effective biological control.

MacArthur (1972) argued that when production is left unused, the system is open to invasion. In the present case I am viewing resources in a wider context but the principle is the same. In terms of biodiversity, nature is doing what it has always done, namely restoration following a decline. The mimicry is two sided. We may be mimicking nature, but nature sees cultivated crops as mimics of resource rich, species poor environments resulting from extinctions and reacts as it has done to these events in the past.

A deer bolts across a field. An average human performs an extraordinary feat of strength to rescue someone in immediate danger. We are generally well versed in the stress response known as “fight or flight.” But what do we know about vertebrates’ other major stress response: the emergency state?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIn fight or flight, sensory organs hear a warning noise or detect danger and send impulses to the brain that scream, “Help!” The brain fires nerves connected to adrenal glands located in the upper portion of the kidneys. Within a few seconds of sensing the danger, these glands pump hormones into our blood.\n\nEpinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine course into our bloodstream. The hormones dock onto receptors dispersed on tissues throughout the body, unlocking various functions that ready us for battle or departure. Pupils dilate, improving vision. The heart races, blood pressure rises, and breathing rate quickens, increasing oxygen intake and distribution. Blood vessels to noncritical organs constrict while those around the brain and muscles dilate, diverting blood to where it’s needed most. These hormones also cause muscles to tremble, priming them for action. If an animal survives the immediate attack, the fight or flight response abruptly ends, and the body resumes normal function within a couple of minutes.\n\nLonger-term stressors like severe weather, loss of a mate, habitat loss, or exposure to pollution cause the second type of stress response, putting the body in a state of emergency. The emergency response is a bit slower, taking from minutes to hours to ramp up. Also, the effects are longer-lived, lasting from hours to weeks, depending on the duration of the stressor.\n\nAs with fight or flight, hormones drive the emergency response. In this case, the brain sends signals to a different region of the adrenal glands, releasing a group of hormones called glucocorticoids. In fish and mammals, glucocorticoids consist primarily of cortisol, but in reptiles, birds, amphibians, and rodents, the main glucocorticoid is corticosterone. These hormones generally help regulate glucose production, immune system function, and reproduction. They also affect migrating and feeding behaviors.\n\nWhen a stressor increases glucocorticoid production, the emergency response shifts resources from long‑term investments to survival mode.\n\nThe Potential\n\nStudying the stress response in animals, especially chronic stress, could help us design fish farms, zoos, and research facilities to reduce animal stress. Larger cages, natural lighting, and appropriate temperature can all mitigate chronic stress symptoms. Considering behavioral needs such as social interactions and stimulating natural activities can also reduce chronic stress in captivity. Animals provide us much. Learning to reduce their stress in captivity can go a long way toward making our interactions more mutually positive.\n\nAdditionally, we humans are animals like any other, and much of our modern lifestyle involves conditions that are known to activate the emergency stress response: constrained quarters, separation from the natural environment, persistent questions about security or stability. The stress response is nature’s way of drawing attention to harmful conditions. Heeding its message could help us to create better living conditions for people in all levels of society in all sorts of environments, including shelters, office buildings, schools, or apartments, and even lead to better rehabilitation of those in prisons or recovery in hospitals."}, {"Source": "bone", "Application": "composite building materials", "Function1": "protect bone from fracture", "Function2": "dissipate energy", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/crystals-and-fibers-provide-strength-flexibility/", "Strategy": "Flexible Collagen Fibers With\nStrong Minerals Dissipate Energy\n\nA combination of mineral crystals and collagen fibers protects bone from major fractures by sacrificing small structural elements.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn our hands, in our legs, around our brains: Bones provide structural support for the bodies of humans and of every other vertebrate, from fish to tigers to birds.\n\nIt might seem that bone is inflexible, but its basic component is a springy and versatile protein called collagen––found in elastic tissues like skin, tendons, and ligaments. Collagen molecules consist of three intertwining spiral chains, allowing the molecules themselves to bend and stretch. Individual molecules then overlay one another in a staggered pattern like bricks in a wall, forming relatively fine fiber structures called “fibrils.” If bone were comprised of just collagen, it might make yoga poses easier but it wouldn’t be very strong.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nEnter calcium, the mineral that gives bone its strength and hardness. When bone develops, calcium crystals form in the gaps and bond to the flexible collagen like mortar amid the bricks.\n\nDr. Markus Buehler, a materials engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, compared the stress behavior of ordinary collagen fibrils to mineralized collagen fibrils. Buehler analyzed the stress exerted on bundles of fibrils under the strain of pulling their two ends apart. At first, fibrils with and without minerals both stretch like a rubber band. They don’t stretch as much as a rubber band, but the stress on the tissue increases linearly with the strain of pulling. Keep tugging, however, and the fibrils deform, releasing the tension the way caramel candy does when you stretch it.\n\nThis is the point where the calcium makes a difference. Pull even harder on pure collagen fibrils and they continue to behave like caramel candy. During what’s called plastic deformation, molecules easily slip past one another and only a tenuous string connects the two ends. It becomes easier and easier to pull them apart as the wispy connective string stretches and thins. Eventually, failure occurs and the two ends separate.\n\nIn contrast, when mineralized collagen fibrils begin plastic deformation, their slipping molecules are quickly interrupted. The stress lurches down, then up again as the strong bonds between crystals and collagen break one at a time. This spreads the molecular slipping over many stages. Imagine trying to open an extension ladder that catches on every rung. Tugging hard cracks the bond between one mineral and one collagen molecule and releases a single ladder rung. But then the ladder snags on another bond until enough force breaks that and pulls the next rung down. Before reaching structural failure, all the bonds must break. In this way, minerals dissipate energy, permitting failure on minute scales to protect the entire bone from fracturing.\n\nThe Potential\n\nBones need to be tough but able to dissipate the forces we put them under. If they couldn’t bend slightly, they’d snap apart every time we jumped or fell. In that regard, bones are like other composite building materials that give man-made structures strength while imparting the flexibility to dissipate energy from wind, earthquakes, and storms. Furthermore, engineering design—like staged molecular slipping—usually includes redundancy so that when small elements fail, the overall structure remains intact."}, {"Source": "fijian red seaweed's bromophycolide compound", "Application": "antimalarial compounds", "Function1": "interrupt the parasite's ability to protect itself", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/compounds-disrupt-malaria-parasite/", "Strategy": "Compounds Disrupt Malaria Parasite\n\nBromophycolide compounds in the Fijian red seaweed provide protection against malaria by interrupting the parasite's ability to protect itself from toxic byproducts.\n\n\nMore than a million people die each year from malaria, which is caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

While that’s a non-issue for the seaweed itself, it’s good news to red-blooded humans because the malarial parasite feasts on our oxygen-carrying hemoglobin. As the parasite masticates hemoglobin, free heme molecules are released. To protect themselves from the toxicity of free heme, the parasite transforms it into nontoxic hemozoin. It’s this transformation that bromophycolide A disrupts, leaving the parasite vulnerable to the toxic crumbs left at its dining table.\n\nChemists have examined the chemical architecture of bromophycolide A to determine which functional groups decorating the molecule play key roles in the antimalarial process. It appears that carbon atoms at positions 15 and 18 (see structure diagram) play key roles, the former designed with functional groups that do not facilitate hydrogen bonding with free heme and carbon 18 designed to promote it. Such results will provide insight for potential future designs of bromophycolide-inspired antimalarial compounds. It is not clear at this time if the antifungal activity of bromophycolide uses a similar mechanism."}, {"Source": "cucumber's leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "disorient males", "Function2": "prevent attack", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-disorient-beetles-prevent-attack/", "Strategy": "Leaves Disorient Beetles, Prevent Attack\n\nThe leaves of cucumbers prevent infestation by beetles by releasing a chemical that mimics that of female beetles, disorienting the males.\n\n“Under normal conditions, for example, a young cucumber plant can disorient many of the small beetles that live on its leaves.

However, they lack wood and are in fact some of the world’s largest herbs. Wood is how trees are able to withstand the forces required to grow so large, so how do papayas, which often grow in regions subject to frequent high winds, manage to stand tall without wood?\n\nThe answer is a mixture of factors. Papayas, like all large plants, have two sets of vessels responsible for transporting water up from the roots, and sugars down from the leaves. The two sets of vessels have very different physical characteristics and, in papayas, these work together to make a stronger stem. The phloem, which transports sugars down from the leaves, can withstand tension (stretching) forces, while the xylem, which transports water up from the roots, is able to withstand compression (squeezing).\n\nAs well as the pairing of xylem and phloem, papayas also use turgor pressure to grow so tall. Plant cells are like bags of water surrounded by a rigid box (the cell wall). If water is lost from the bag, the walls of the box can collapse, while if the wall breaks, the bag can be squashed. Together, however, the water-filled bag inside the cell wall is strong. This mechanism is how all herbaceous plants stand up and you can see it in the wilting of your house plants if you forget to water them. Turgor pressure is the water pressure inside the cell and wilting happens when plants suffering from drought cannot maintain sufficient turgor pressure and their cells collapse under the weight of the plant’s own tissues. In papayas, the turgor pressure is much higher than other plants (up to 1.25 MPa), enabling it to grow taller. It would be disastrous for a plant as large as a papaya to wilt, they preferentially protect the turgor pressure in their stems and instead drop their oldest leaves when subjected to drought.\n\nBut even this isn’t the whole story, and a combination of all these factors is needed to grow so tall. The xylem cells of papaya plants are full of water and it is here their high turgor pressure is most important. The xylem tubes are arranged in a hexagonal array in the middle of the stem, and the cells that make them up bulge out. This puts a constant stretching force on the phloem tubes that form the outer layer of the stem. In this way, the complementary properties of the xylem and phloem and the high turgor pressure of the cells inside the stem all work together, enabling papayas to achieve great heights."}, {"Source": "hedgehog's hibernation", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "slow metabolism", "Function2": "decrease organ function", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/hibernation-induces-dramatic-physiological-changes/", "Strategy": "Hibernation Induces Dramatic\nPhysiological Changes\n\nHibernating hedgehogs slow their metabolism and organ function to a near standstill.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen the going gets tough, hedgehogs (Erinaceidae) stop going. These unassuming garden dwellers enter an astoundingly deep state of torpor in which all their bodily functions slow nearly to a standstill.\n\nIn cold winters, they would need to expend lots of energy just to keep their body temperatures warm enough to survive. And food to refuel is scarce. So they conserve the fat supplies that they have diligently accumulated in months when they gorge on vegetation—by means of extreme hibernation.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nIn extreme hibernation hedgehogs’ heart rates decrease from between 190 and 280 beats per minute to just under 14 beats per minute. Their breathing diminishes from 50 breaths per minute when active and 25 when resting all the way down to 13 or fewer. Their body temperature, normally about 95°F (35°C), drops to around 45-50°F (7-10°C).\n\nAll the biochemical reactions in their body slow down, and their organs, from heart to liver to brain, all but cease operating. Their metabolism plummets by 95%, and they expend about 216 times less energy per day. Fat reserves that active hedgehogs would use up in 16 hours last for about 120 days.\n\nMany people mistakenly consider hibernation to be a really deep sleep. But it is distinctly different. Sleep is actually a time of active restoration for the body. During sleep, organs and metabolism don’t shut down as they do in hibernation. They continue to work, though at a resting pace. The process is so distinct and important that every few days or so, hedgehogs briefly come out of hibernation—to sleep.\n\nAll hibernating animals have these short bursts of “arousals” when they burn some fat to raise their body temperatures and turn on their organs for a few hours, before returning to a state of torpor. Scientists speculate that these brief arousals allow hibernating animals to do some minimal maintenance on their vital organs. They catch up on sleep to restore brain function. They may clear gradually accumulating metabolic wastes, rebalance electrolyte levels, prevent muscles from atrophying, or wake up the immune system to combat bacteria that can slip in.\n\nThe Potential\n\nScientists are keenly investigating the physiological mechanisms that allow hibernating animals to shut down vital systems for such long periods without causing damage. Insights could lead to new medical therapies. Among these are ways to prevent tissue damage after strokes, or muscle and bone degeneration in people who haven’t been able to move for long periods because of surgery, injury, or disease.\n\nDoctors could also find better techniques to cool down bodies during cardiac surgeries to reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel damage, and to preserve transplant organs for longer periods to transport them to far-flung patients before the organs deteriorate.\n\nScientists are also exploring how hibernating animals seem to readily remove “tau proteins” that build up in their brains—the same proteins found to accumulate in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. And they are investigating whether humans can be coaxed into hibernation, enabling years-long space journeys to seem to pass in the very long blink of an eye.\n\nThe Potential Even though insects have a different stress response than humans and other animals, studying it is important because of the role insects play in ecosystems around the world.

Many birds, mammals, fish, and reptiles depend on insects for food, making them an integral part of a vast food chain. Insects pollinate flowering plants and crops, providing food indirectly to humans and other large animals. Many insects also help clean our environment, feeding on waste like dung and dead plants and animals.\n\nAlthough the sight of certain insects may cause stress in certain people, insects themselves experience stress from many causes as well. Extreme weather, famine, pesticides, and even crowding can cause stress in insects. Similar to humans and other animals, hormones regulate how insects respond to stress.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nHumans have a “fight or flight” mechanism driven primarily by adrenaline, a hormone classified as a biogenic amine. Insects also produce biogenic amine hormones as their first line of defense to an immediate threat. In humans, the fight or flight response diverts oxygen and blood from less urgent functions to muscles, priming them for action. In insects, these hormones alter metabolism to supply muscles with immediate energy, also mobilizing them to battle or escape from a predator.\n\nHumans and other vertebrates use glucocorticoid hormones to weather longer-lasting stressors. Insects use a related class of hormones, called ecdysiotropins, but other hormones also help them survive extreme conditions. In most cases, these hormones work together to shift metabolism and sustain energy demands. Adipokinetic hormone, for example, provides added energy to wing muscles during stress flight.\n\nHowever, ecdysiotropins and other hormones that influence stress also affect normal insect growth. Adding to the complexity, growing insects undergo metamorphosis—molting or transforming from larva to pupa or from nymph to adult, depending on the type of insect. It’s not yet well understood how stress affects insects in different life stages, and scientists have observed a range of responses. For example, the same injury caused premature molting in younger caterpillars but delayed molting in older ones. Also, some stressors slow growth, while others accelerate it.\n\nThe Potential\n\nEven though insects have a different stress response than humans and other animals, studying it is important because of the role insects play in ecosystems around the world. We depend on the contributions they make, and multiple lines of evidence point to insect populations and diversity plummeting all over. In areas where species are threatened, perhaps we can develop methods that adjust their metabolisms to help them thrive in the face of global warming and other human-caused environmental stressors.

How can a material that’s literally as light as a feather provide such warmth? The secret is in the structure. And a close look at a down feather reveals how it works.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nTypical outer feathers, like the ones quill pens were made of, don’t have this insulating effect. They have a firm central trunk called a rachis. Stiff shafts called barbs jut diagonally off the rachis to the left and right like branches. The barbs have smaller structures branching off of them called barbules. The barbules have tiny hooks called prongs that grab adjacent barbules, keeping them closely interlocked and aligned. The whole feather structure is basically straight and flat. That makes them great for flying or keeping out water, but not much good for retaining heat.\n\nDown feathers, in contrast, have a short rachis that looks more like a stem than a trunk. Long barbs extend out of the top. But unlike outer-feather barbs, down barbs aren’t stiff. They are soft and flexible, as are their barbules. They billow out in all directions and overlap to form fluffy spheres. Each barbule is more than 10 times thinner than a strand of human hair, but a single feather may contain miles of them.\n\nThe wispy spheres are ideally shaped to splay out and clump together. They fill up empty spaces where air could pass through. They create a cohesive barrier that traps in an insulating layer of air. The down also blocks cold winds from sweeping away the bird’s heat. Because the feathers are flexible, they don’t break when they are compressed, and they quickly fluff out again.\n\nThe feathers of other types of ducks and geese have similar features. But zoom into the down of eider ducks, and you’ll see what puts it in a class of its own.\n\nEider ducks live and nest along the most northern coastlines on Earth. They need to keep warm as they forage for food in icy waters. Beneath their waterproof outer feathers, a layer of down traps heat just the way a down vest does for us. Back on land, they need to protect their eggs from frigid temperatures and fierce winds. This, too, they do with down. Adults pluck down feathers from their breasts to cushion and insulate their nests.\n\nFor these high-performance needs, eiders have developed barbules on their down that are bigger than those of other ducks or geese, so they fill more gaps. Their barbules have more prongs near their tips, and the prongs are shaped like tridents, rather than the two-tine prongs of other birds, so they stick together better. Like tent poles, they keep the ends of the barbules from flying outward, maintaining a heat-trapping tent-like shape. These extra features make eider down feathers even more cohesive and warm—a necessity for living and breeding in the harsh arctic conditions.\n\nThe Potential\n\nBecause down is insulating, light, and compressible, it is an ideal material to make warm jackets, vests, gloves, sleeping bags, and quilts. Revealing the microscopic structures and mechanisms that give eider down its remarkable properties can show people ways to develop synthetic insulating materials that mimic what feathers do naturally.\n"}, {"Source": "dehesa", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "maintain a diversity of products", "Function2": "long-term ecological sustainability", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ecosystem-has-long-term-sustainability/", "Strategy": "Ecosystem Has Long‑term Sustainability\n\nDehesas maintain a diversity of products and long-term ecological sustainability by sub-optimization of resources.\n\n“The dehesas of the southwestern Iberian Peninsula are ‘man-made’ ecosystems characterised by a savannah-like physiognomy.

At the local scale, strong soil structural differences and functional differences in water budget and patterns of water use are observed under and outside the tree canopy.

Borrelia burgdorferi  is a species of spiral bacteria that somehow eludes the body’s immune defenses. Standard tests don’t detect its presence.\nThis bacteria is transmitted to humans via tick bites. Over the past two decades, the number of infected ticks has skyrocketed. Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from Lyme disease every year. Symptoms include rashes, fever, chills, headaches, fatigue, sweating, dizziness, tremors, and muscle and joint pain. Untreated, these disabling symptoms can persist or resurface for years.\n\nA key way to prevent long-term problems is to start treatment in the critical early stages of infections. But many different medical conditions can cause similar symptoms. Without a valid way to home in on B. burgdoferi, doctors can overlook Lyme disease. Or worse, they can misdiagnose and futilely treat the wrong ailment.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nSo what makes B. burgdorferi different from other bacteria? The answer, as Sherlock Holmes might put it, is elemental. Bacteria typically use iron to make enzymes that they need to grow and function. But scientists have found that Lyme disease-causing bacteria has evolved to substitute iron’s next-door neighbor on the periodic table: manganese.\n\nUnlike most bacteria, B. burgdorferi doesn’t need iron to grow. In standard detection tests, blood, urine, or other samples are cultured in labs to grow bacteria and reveal their presence. But iron-free B. burgdorferi doesn’t grow well in these tests and evades detection.\n\nInstead, Lyme disease tests rely on detecting the presence of antibodies that the body makes to fight bacteria. But it can take a while to produce antibodies. They can also linger from older or different illnesses. So results from Lyme disease antibody tests aren’t very timely, accurate, or easy to interpret.\n\nThe Lyme disease-causing bacteria’s manganese substitution also helps it dodge immune system defense mechanisms. One such mechanism is that the body makes chemicals that inhibit the gut from absorbing iron and sending it into the bloodstream. That makes us anemic, which is why we feel tired and weak when we’re sick. But it also effectively starves most pathogens of the iron they need to build enzymes.\n\nBut not B. burgdorferi. It can continue to make enzymes with manganese instead of iron. Some of these enzymes protect them against another immune defense. The body bombards bacteria with superoxide radicals. These highly reactive molecules damage most bacteria. But B. burgdorferi makes manganese enzymes that neutralize superoxides.\n\nThe Potential \n\nThe discovery opens new avenues to look for novel ways to detect and fight Lyme disease. Humans do not have manganese-containing enzymes. So any therapies that target those enzymes would be effective on B. burgdorferi and safe for people. Additionally, it shows an example of the advantage gained by an organism when it can swap out a resource that other organisms depend on and that  is commonly targeted by both defensive and offensive processes."}, {"Source": "tree trunk", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "reduce wind stress", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/branching-design-lessens-breakage/", "Strategy": "Branching Design Lessens Breakage\n\nBranching design lessens chances of trees breaking by structurally reducing wind stress.\n\n“The graceful taper of a tree trunk into branches, boughs, and twigs is so familiar that few people notice what Leonardo da Vinci observed: a tree almost always grows so that the total thickness of the branches at a particular height is equal to the thickness of the trunk…Eloy [primary investigator], a specialist in fluid mechanics, agreed that the equation had something to do with a tree’s leaves, not in how they took up water, and the force of the wind caught by the leaves as it blew…’Trees are very diverse organisms, and Christophe [Eloy] seems to have arrived at a simple and elegant physical principle that explains how branches taper in size as you go from the trunk, through the boughs, up to the twigs,’ says Marcus Roper, a mathematician at UC Berkeley. ‘It’s surprising and wonderful that no one thought of [the wind explanation] sooner.'” "}, {"Source": "riparian system", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "recover from floods", "Function2": "adapt to floods", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/communities-recover-from-floods/", "Strategy": "Communities Recover From Floods\n\nRiparian systems recover from floods by having plant communities that are adapted to the disturbances.\n\n“Floods also represent major disturbances that influence riparian plant communities.

At any stage though, a new flood may destroy the vegetation and reset the sequence.

The pattern of reorganization among plants is often dependent on modes of dispersal and the presence or absence of dispersers. In tropical rain forests, vertebrate frugivores are often the main seed vectors (78). In a lowland rain forest in Samoa disturbed by cyclones and fires, seedlings of species dispersed by birds or flying foxes were most abundant in the most severely disturbed area, but this was not the case in less disturbed areas (79). Remnant trees may attract seed-dispersers such as fruit-eating birds and bats (37, 80–82). Vertebrate frugivores can be viewed as keystones in the reorganization phase. In their absence, succession would follow a different trajectory dominated by wind- and passively dispersed plants, and the risk of invasion of wind-dispersed exotic species may increase.

It also serves as an attachment site for muscles around the throat, tongue, and head.\n\nThe hyoid bone begins in the nostril of the upper beak, where it divides into two parts between the eyes, and then travels over the top of the skull and around the back. At the base of the skull, the separate pieces rejoin and attach to the muscle of the tongue (see illustration below). The woodpecker not only uses the hyoid bone to gather food for meals, but to protect its brain from neurological trauma. This happens in two ways.\n\nFirst, when the woodpecker pecks, the muscles surrounding the relaxed hyoid bone contract, propelling the tongue forward inside the beak, and even further when collecting food.

For some creatures that’s the case, which is why material scientists look to creatures like the rainbow mantis shrimp for ideas about how to make materials stronger.\nThe peacock mantis shrimp, a multi-colored 5-inch crustacean that lives in coral reefs from Guam to East Africa, hunts shellfish by smashing through their hard shells using its club-shaped appendage. Its club travels faster than 50 mph (80 kph), exceeding the speed of a bullet from a .22 caliber gun, traveling so fast that the seawater literally boils in the club’s wake. Their formidable club makes members of this species dicey to keep in an aquarium, because they’ve been known to punch through the glass.\n\nThe 3D model at left illustrates the structure revealed in found in electronscanning microscope image at right of the mantis shrimp’s dactyl club and telson.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe mantis shrimp’s club is made of intricately designed material to make it especially crack-resistant. A strong calcium-based mineral surrounds the outside of the club. Below this layer, the club’s design is dominated by the orientation of mineralized fibers.\n\nThe shrimp uses long chains of carbohydrates to attract, orient, and solidify inorganic minerals out of the surrounding seawater. The resulting fibers of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are biomineralized into circular layers, which resist sideways expansion during impact, keeping the club together.\n\nBetween these circular layers, sheets of blended (composite) materials made of chitin and protein are stacked one upon the other, each set of fibers rotated slightly from the fiber alignment below. This creates a spiraled structure in cross-section, like a twisted stack of printer paper. This spiraled region of the shrimp’s club helps absorb the impact from each blow, much like a spring, and channels any cracks that do form in the club around within the club’s material, weakening their force and preventing straight cracks from forming and splitting the club apart.\n\nThe Potential\n\nNew human-made materials using insights from the way the rainbow mantis shrimp’s club is designed are much tougher.

The high-speed pecking motion of the golden-fronted woodpecker causes a tremendous amount of stressed force on the animal. To prevent physical and neurological trauma, the frontal portion of the woodpecker’s skull is comprised of plate-like spongy bone called cancellous bone.\n\nWhen the woodpecker’s beak strikes an object, the high impact force at its tip is relieved by the anatomy of its beak and the spongy hyoid bone. As a result, the stress force from the impact is reduced two to eight times from the beak tip to the point where the beak meets its skull.\n\nOf the forces that do reach the woodpecker’s skull, the unique structure of its cranial bone prevents forces from reaching its brain and cranial cavity. This cranial bone is a mixture of tightly packed, dense compact bone surrounding a deeper bone that is layered in staggered, plate-like structures that create a dense shock absorption system. When forces intersect with this deeper bone, its porous and layered structure scatters frequencies in divergent directions away from the central point of impact.

This is accomplished by the interaction between the high surface-area multi-scale micro- and nano- topography on their wing surfaces and the physical properties of water molecules.\n\nWhile a variety of specific structures appear in this wing surface topography, all share a similar mathematical set of proportions in the size and distance of protrusions that are associated with superhydrophobicity (extreme non-wettability).

In order to get better, the body needs to kill or stop the growth of these bacteria. Doctors give medicines called antibiotics to help the body get rid of an infection. Penicillin is a common antibiotic often used to stop bacteria from growing. It does this by preventing the bacteria from building a cell wall, which makes it difficult for it to grow and reproduce. However, bacteria can build resistance, or develop a defense against antibiotics. This makes the antibiotic less effective at killing the bacteria.\n\nHumans are currently overusing antibiotics, and as a result there are more antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Penicillin, and other antibiotics in the same family, are becoming less effective at killing bacteria. Therefore, scientists have to find a new kind of antibiotic that will stop the growth of bacteria in other ways. One current approach is to disrupt cell division, which prevents bacteria from being able to divide.\n\nFor bacteria to grow, it first needs to reproduce. It does this by dividing into two daughter cells that have the same DNA. For the cell to divide, a special enzyme called  autolysin has to bind to the cell wall and break it down. Once the cell wall is broken, the cells can then divide. If autolysin is disrupted or is not functioning properly, cells cannot divide.\n\nCorbomycin is a compound found in soil bacteria. It works by attaching to the bacterial cell wall and preventing autolysin from binding. As a result, bacterial cells cannot divide and are essentially “trapped” within their own cell walls.

Critical in this process is the stoma. Stomata (multiple stoma) are located on the outermost cellular layer of leaves, stems, and other plant parts. An open stoma facilitates the process of photosynthesis in three ways. First, it allows light to enter the intercellular matter and trigger the process. Second, it allows for the uptake of carbon dioxide, a key chemical in producing plant energy. Third, it allows for oxygen to be expelled into the outside environment, a byproduct of photosynthesis that is no longer needed by the cell.\n\nWhile an open stoma is necessary for the plant to undergo photosynthesis, it comes with a negative side effect: water loss. Over 95% of a plant’s water loss occurs through the stoma via water vapor. Therefore, a delicate balance must be maintained that allows light and gases to pass between cells, and does not put the plant at risk for dehydration.\n\nThis problem is mitigated with guard cells. Guard cells are a pair of two cells that surround each stoma opening. To open, the cells are triggered by one of many possible environmental or chemical signals. These can include strong sunlight or higher than average levels of carbon dioxide inside the cell. In response to these signals, the guard cells take in sugars, potassium, and chloride ions (i.e., solutes) through their membranes. An increase in solutes induces an influx of water across the guard cell membrane. As the volume of the guard cells increase, they “inflate” into two kidney-bean-like shapes. As they expand, they reveal the stoma opening in the center of the two guard cells (similar to a hole in the center of a doughnut). Once fully expanded, the stoma is open and gases can move between the cell and external environment.\n\nThe stoma’s pore closes in the opposite manner. Excess loss of water through the stoma, such as during a drought, triggers chemical reactions that signal water and ions to leave the guard cells. As solutes exit the guard cells, the pair “deflates,” subsequently closing the stoma like two flat balloons.\n\nThis summary was contributed by Allison Miller."}, {"Source": "plant tissue", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from tension", "Function2": "resist tension", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/two-phase-composite-tissues-handle-tension/", "Strategy": "Two‑phase Composite Tissues Handle Tension\n\nTissues of plants protect from tension by having a biphasic layer of cellulose microfibers against a matrix of hemicelluloses and lignin.\n\n“The first portion of the biphasic stress-strain curve, exhibiting a high modulus of elasticity and little viscoelasticity, is due to elastic extension.

Which, again in obedience to the dictates of the real world, our arterial walls do–aneurysms, fortunately, remain rare and pathological. We accomplish the trick first, by incorporating fibers of a non-stretchy material, collagen, in those walls, and second, by arranging those fibers in a particular way. Thus, as the wall expands outward, more and more of these inextensible fibers are stretched out to their full lengths and add their resistance to stretch to that of the wall as a whole…Arterial walls that resist stretch disproportionately as they extend characterize circulatory systems that have evolved within lineages quite distinct from our own–in cephalopods and arthropods, for instance. Recruitable collagen fibers don’t represent the only possible solution to the basic problem, and they’re not nature’s inevitable choice.” (Vogel 2003:7-8)\n\n“The most important mechanical property of the artery wall is its non-linear elasticity. Over the last century, this has been well-documented in vessels in many animals, from humans to lobsters. Arteries must be distensible to provide capacitance and pulse-smoothing in the circulation, but they must also be stable to inflation over a range of pressure. These mechanical requirements are met by strain-dependent increases in the elastic modulus of the vascular wall, manifest by a J-shaped stress–strain curve, as typically exhibited by other soft biological tissues. All vertebrates and invertebrates with closed circulatory systems have arteries with this non-linear behaviour, but specific tissue properties vary to give correct function for the physiological pressure range of each species. In all cases, the non-linear elasticity is a product of the parallel arrangement of rubbery and stiff connective tissue elements in the artery wall, and differences in composition and tissue architecture can account for the observed variations in mechanical properties. This phenomenon is most pronounced in large whales, in which very high compliance in the aortic arch and exceptionally low compliance in the descending aorta occur, and is correlated with specific modifications in the arterial structure.” "}, {"Source": "watercress plant cell", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "resist compression", "Function2": "absorb impact", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/tetradecahedral-shaped-cells-resist-compression-2/", "Strategy": "Shape of Cells Resists Compression\n\nTetradecahedral-shaped cells allow for maximal packing space while also resisting compression.\n\nWatercress is a species of aquatic plant native to Asia and Europe.

In order to ensure a long trip, leaves that are able to float on the surface can ensure maximum sun absorption for photosynthesis. The larger a leaf is, the more surface area it can expose for photosynthesis, and the more aggressively it can compete with other leaves for space on the surface of the water. One of the most extreme examples of this is the leaves of the Amazon water lily, which float on the water of the Amazon river basin and grow up to several meters across. Its massive surface area allows it to maximize sun exposure, but also makes it more difficult to keep afloat and makes it susceptible to damage from animals that use the leaves as a means to get across the river. To cope with this, the Amazon water lily has a significant support system on the underside of its leaves, which allow it to sustain weights up to 70 pounds, while still remaining afloat.\nUnderneath each leaf is a ribbed, girder-like support structure that helps the leaf support small loads and hold a rigid shape, in order to maximize surface area exposure for photosynthesis.

The ribs themselves are flat, wall-shaped structures, and the thickness of the ribs decreases towards the edge of the leaf. All of the ribs are filled with air, which helps to reduce the total weight of the structure and also helps keep the leaf afloat.

This layer is called a biofilm. It is a slimy, sticky protective layer that covers the bacteria and protects it from environmental stressors, such as high heat or toxic chemicals. It is made up of a gel the bacteria produce (called “extra-polymeric substance”, EPS), and other captured particles. Common examples of biofilms include dental plaque, the slippery gel found on rocks in streams, and the orangey-coating that appears in your toilet bowl if it isn’t regularly cleaned!\n\nAs a bacterial colony grows, their biofilms will often form complex, starburst-like patterns. The growth of the biofilm depends on many factors, but one of the most important is the availability of food. If a biofilm forms on a surface that has food on it, the bacteria will finish the food and will then grow in all directions to find more food, creating a circular shape. This circular growth maximizes food consumption and increases the chances of finding food because the colony is growing in all directions at once.\n\nAs the colony grows, sometimes an individual bacterium will eat faster than the others. This causes a part of the biofilm to stretch out in a certain direction. When the food runs out in that area, the bacteria stop growing in that direction and need to find another direction to grow in. To picture this, imagine a highway full of people trying to get off at a certain exit. One day, the exit closes and everyone needs to use a different exit. Suddenly there is a really long line of traffic because everyone is trying to find another route.  When the bacteria hit this kind of ‘traffic jam’ and need to move in a different direction, they start to grow on top of one another. This causes ‘wrinkles’ to occur in the biofilm. A biofilm can have several wrinkles that form different patterns of peaks and valleys (see video here).\n\nIn addition to food, scientists have also found that biofilm growth patterns are also affected by the type of surface they grow on. On soft surfaces, such as styrofoam or skin, biofilms start growing as a flat layer but later become wrinkled. This is because it is easy for a biofilm to grow smoothly in all directions and it takes longer for wrinkles to form. On hard surfaces, such as a rock or plastic, it is harder for the bacteria to grow in all directions at once. Because of this, wrinkles form very quickly in the biofilm, and these wrinkles are closer to the center ."}, {"Source": "seahorse's square tail", "Application": "search and rescue robots", "Function1": "help grip", "Function2": "hold on securely", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/the-seahorse-has-a-square-tail-to-help-it-grip-objects/", "Strategy": "Square Tail Helps Grip\n\nThe square tail of the seahorse helps give it extra grip when hunting for prey.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile most fish use their tails for swimming, seahorses, a type of fish found in shallow, tropical waters, use their tails in another way.

One way to imagine this is a car tire.  A car tire is a circular shape from the side, but is flat where it contacts the road, so that more of it can touch the road and help control the car, as shown in the sketch below.  If a car tire was more rounded where it touched the road, only a small point of the tire would touch the ground, and the tires would not help control the car as well. This is also true of the seahorse: if its tail was made up of circular bones, there would be less contact area for it to grip onto objects with.\n\nWhen the seahorse grips onto an object, the four plates contract and slide past each other. This flexibility also makes it easier for the seahorse to adjust or tighten its grip. As it releases its grip, the bones slide back into their original position. The ability to have a tighter grip allows the seahorse to hold on more securely when the ocean currents are strong, allowing it to hunt for prey more effectively.\n\nThe Potential\n\nWhen designing robots to perform tasks, it might seem like mimicking human hands would be the best choice to achieve a wide range of finite and precise movements. But nature has evolved many techniques for gripping objects, each suited for particular tasks. For example, the seahorse’s tail-gripping mechanism might be ideal for machines doing work underwater or in applications where material may be slippery. Because seahorse tails are flexible, they can bend and resist damage. Similar flexibility may help search and rescue robots navigate precarious environments to save humans."}, {"Source": "mulberry plant's rough leaves", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent infection", "Function2": "confuse fungal spores", "Function3": "mask the regular features", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/rough-leaves-prevent-infection/", "Strategy": "Rough Leaves Prevent Infection\n\nRough leaves on mulberry plants prevent infection by confusing fungal spores after they germinate.\n\nPlants need to keep their air passages clear and healthy, just as animals do. Plants “breathe” by taking in air through holes (called stomata) on the surface of their leaves. These pores are often surrounded by raised ridges. Stomata are necessary for a plant to survive, but they are also a point of entry for potential pathogens—microorganisms that can cause disease. Fungi like powdery mildew and rusts use these holes to enter and infect leaves.\n\nAfter landing on a leaf, fungal spores germinate and put out thin thread-like tubes (called hyphae). These tubes explore the leaf’s surface looking for stomata. When the hyphae find a pore, they enter and fill it. From there they grow into the plant tissue, digesting and consuming it.\n\nHow do fungi find these pores? It turns out they respond to the texture of the leaf surface. Rusts recognize ridges on the plant surface and grow at right angles to them, increasing their chance of locating stomata, while powdery mildew recognizes the shape of special cells around the stomata and uses them as a cue.\n\nMulberry trees live in wet climates that can put plants at greater risk of infection by fungi. Some species of mulberry, however, have evolved unique texturing on their leaves. These surface patterns confuse fungal hyphae, masking the regular features that otherwise signal the presence of stomata.\n\nFungal hyphae cannot penetrate directly through the leaf surface that they land on and must enter through stomata. And hyphae can’t revert to spore form once they germinate.

As the baby develops, the plates grow and fuse so that by around 18 months of age, the gaps have disappeared. However, the bones do not completely fuse and the joins between them, called cranial sutures, are packed with soft connective tissue and function as very stiff joints. These joints provide a mixture of protection and flexibility that enable the cranium to accommodate the growing brain. Cranial sutures do finally ossify (become solid bone), but not until we are around 30 years of age, when the brain has finally ceased to grow. In turtles, the shell is formed when bony plates that grow between the ribs fuse. Fusion occurs after the turtle has hatched and remains a stiff but slightly flexible suture joint for its entire life.\n\nSutures have a unique structure: they form wavy interdigitations, with bone from each adjoining plate inserting finger-like projections into the plate next to it. This forms the very wiggly line that gives the feature its name.\n\nLike vertebrate skulls, turtle shell sutures are also highly wavy. In their case, however, the interdigitations form in three dimensions, meaning the sutures are wavy through the shell as well as along it. In a turtle shell, impact protection is the primary function, and so resistance is critical. However, various internal organs required for movement and respiration are attached to the inside of the shell and these can be more efficiently carried out if the structure has some flexibility.

Such large fruit falling from such a height are at risk of being damaged by the impact, but to maximize their chances of reproducing, the trees need the fallen fruit to stay good for as long as possible. This gives time to the animals that eat pomelos to find them, carry them away, and spread the eaten seeds. The trees are native to hot and humid regions and any splits in the skin caused by the fall will give access to microorganisms that cause fruit to spoil. To protect from impact, pomelos have a compressible skin 2-3 cms thick. Most citrus fruit have been altered by selective breeding, but the pomelo is one of the three “true” citrus and so its thick skin is due to the need to protect the fruit and not due to human intervention.\n\nThe skin of the pomelo has multiple layers. The outermost layer, called the exocarp, is densely packed with cells. The next layer, which forms the bulk of the peel, is called the mesocarp. Inside the mesocarp is the endocarp, which contains all the seeds and pulp segments of the fruit. The mesocarp, or pith, is the layer primarily responsible for protecting the fruit from impact, and it is an open porous foam. That is, the mesocarp is made of many air cells that are interconnected with each other. When the fruit falls, these air pockets collapse like a cushion, absorbing the energy of impact, protecting the endocarp and exocarp from damage. Unlike a simple foam cushion, the struts that make up the physical structure of the foam mesocarp are fluid-filled and under pressure. Rupturing these struts absorbs even more energy and ensures the pomelo is exceptionally good at surviving a fall.\n\nLayered materials can separate under stress, or become delaminated. When this occurs they lose their physical properties. The layers of the pomelo are not clearly defined. Instead, the exocarp gradually transitions into mesocarp that at first has small air-filled gaps that become gradually larger closer to the center of the fruit.

This is brought about not by manipulating ion levels, but by ‘topping up’ the ionic concentration of the plasma with the non-ionic solute urea CO(NH2)2 (Fig. 3.4).

Looking more like delicate sculptures than animals, these tube-shaped sea sponges typically stand 10 to 30 cm tall and filter tiny food particles from the seawater as it flows through their bodies. Also known as glass sponges, their cylindrical skeletons are made out of silica, the main component of glass. While glass is normally a brittle and fragile material, the Venus’ flower basket’s skeleton is tough and stable owing to its composition and how it’s organized. There are at least six levels of organization in the skeleton that span from nanometers to centimeters in size.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe sponge’s glass skeleton is made up of spicules, tubule structures of concentric layers of amorphous hydrated silica separated by thin organic layers, like a Parisian pastry with just a tease of sweet cream between flaky crusts. But these thin organic layers go a long way to impart the spicules with considerable toughness. Even the pair of symbiotic shrimp that live their lives trapped within each Venus’s woven glass basket can’t break out. Unlike biomineralization in other organisms such as the abalone, the mineral portion does not appear to have a regular crystalline pattern. Experiments suggests that the silica layers are made up of colloidal spheres of silica about 50 to 200 nm in diameter, which are in turn made up of smaller spheres about 2.8 nanometers in diameter. By comparison, the smallest sand grains on a beach (also usually silica) are about 60 nm in diameter.\n\nEach spicule consists of alternating layers of inorganic silica and organic compounds, all around a central protein filament. The inorganic layers are made from hydrated silica nanoparticles and are relatively stiff. The organic layers, however, appear to be weaker and able to absorb energy. This laminated organization of alternating stiff and weak layers can prevent cracks at the surface of a spicule from spreading deep into the core.\n\nThe Potential \n\nWhen we think of engineered supports, we often think of giant columns that bolster skyscrapers or huge cables that suspend bridges.

Plant matter has been used by humans in many ways, such as wood for a house or to make paper. Therefore, plant matter can be a good replacement for styrofoam and to take carbon out of the air.

Their superpower? An immune system that has evolved a way not to mount a defense against some infections.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAn animal’s immune system recognizes potentially harmful foreign matter like viruses and bacteria when they enter the body. It also clears the remnants of cells that die and break down in the normal course of living. Proteins called inflammasomes that sense alien invaders are critical components of the immune system. These trigger the production of other immune cells that seek and destroy intruders.\n\nBut the immune response is not without risk to its owner. When immune cells flood in to fight infection, they naturally cause inflammation—swelling, heat, redness and pain. Normally, the cells get rid of the harmful matter quickly and the inflammation subsides. But sometimes, viruses can rev up an animal’s immune system too much. The inflammation becomes too intense or lasts too long. Then it can damage surrounding tissue and cause disease.\n\nBut scientists don’t see viruses triggering the same response in bats. Recent studies have shown that these mammals have a slight variation in their inflammasomes. As a result, they do not readily trigger floods of immune cells to fight viruses. And so bats can tolerate large amounts of many different kinds of viruses without suffering inflammatory diseases like rabies, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. That’s important because they eat loads of virus-carrying insects like mosquitoes. But it also makes bats a reservoir for diseases that can be lethal to people.\n\nSome scientists think bats may have developed this trait because, unlike other mammals, they fly. It’s a behavior that takes a lot of energy and increases wear and tear on cells that release more broken-down cellular bits. The immune system must clean this mess up. If bats had not evolved the ability to dampen their immune response, flying would cause constant inflammation in their bodies.\n\nThe altered inflammasome may also contribute to bats living so long—up to 40 years. As animals age, cells in their bodies break down more often, triggering inflammation and diseases. Any process that reduces inflammation gives those that have it better chances of living longer.\n\nThe Potential \n\nBy understanding how bats tolerate viruses, scientists can find ways to prevent them from transmitting deadly diseases like COVID-19 to people. And by learning how bats’ immune systems dampen inflammation responses, they can explore therapies and drugs that could do the same in people to reduce the impacts of other diseases caused by inflammation and aging.

At this depth, there is an enormous amount of pressure, approximately 700 pounds per square inch, from the water pushing down on the sea urchin in all directions. This is the same as being crushed by a stack of 20 elephants! Surprisingly, sea urchins can withstand this pressure and can grow without developing any cracks in its shell.  Although the sea urchin shell looks fragile, the shape and construction make it quite strong. The shell is constructed of many small plates made of a strong material called calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is formed when calcium oxide, water, and carbon dioxide are combined. Calcium carbonate is found in many places in nature, including coral, seashells, and limestone rocks. It is also the material that helps give concrete its strength. In addition to being made of a strong material, the small plates on the sea urchin shell also interlock together, creating an even stronger and more crack-resistant shell structure.\n\nWhen a predator tries to bite the urchin, the impact of the bite is transferred through all of the small plates rather than just one plate – this distributes the impact of the bite across the shell rather than to a single point. To picture this, imagine two types of hollow glass balls. One ball is made from a single piece and another is made up of many small pieces that fit together. If the ball made from a single piece is punctured, it will crack and the ball will likely shatter.  If the ball made up of many small pieces is punctured, a single piece may be cracked, but because of its structure, it will stay together. The shell is less likely to break because the impact is distributed throughout the different pieces of the shell.\n\nIn addition to the material and the arrangement of the plates, the sea urchin shell is also strong because of its shape. The shell is oblate, meaning it resembles a flattened sphere. The shell naturally develops into this shape as it grows because of the constant intense pressure of the surrounding water.

Despite swarm size, collision rates between locusts are generally low. The process of detecting movement is ubiquitous amongst most animals. Movements are converted into electrical signals by the eye, sent through a chain of neurons, and read by the brain. If a locust, however, detected each of the thousands of its cohorts, its brain would be over-stimulated. To remedy this, the locust has evolved to only recognize movements that will interfere with its flight path. Therefore, it only recognizes objects moving directly toward it, rather than things moving around it.\n\nHow do locusts do this? Locusts convert the movement of each object into a corresponding electrical voltage. An object coming straight toward a locust’s head has a higher voltage than an object moving parallel to it. As the locust flies, moving stimuli are converted into a voltage, and travel up the optic nerve until they hit a neuron called the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD).\n\nAt the end of the LGMD, stimuli must cross a neural synapse, connecting the LGMD to a neuron called the descending contralateral movement detector (DCMD). A synapse is like a river between two neurons, or “land-masses,” that the electrical signals need to jump across. Only certain signals are strong enough to jump across the river and make it to the brain. The LGMD-DCMD synapse is particularly wide (think Mississippi River) and stimuli must have exceptionally large voltages to jump across. In locusts, only stimuli caused by objects moving directly toward it have that voltage. All other stimuli are dismissed or sent to other areas of the brain.\n\nThis mechanism essentially eliminates visual “white noise,” allowing the locust to focus only on those objects that will interfere directly with its flight path.\n\n"}, {"Source": "rodent's tail", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "escape from predators", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/tail-shedding-allows-escape/", "Strategy": "Tail Shedding Allows Escape\n\nThe tails of many rodents assist escape from predators because they can be shed.\n\nCertain species of rodent can also shed their tails. “According to the authoritative mammalian encyclopedia Walker’s mammals of the World (1999), edited by Dr. Ronald M.

The scales have two layers: A hard outer layer that protects from the teeth of hungry predators, and a soft underlayer that is flexible enough to “bounce back” and recover its shape if an attack occurs.\n\nThe Bouligand structure looks like a spiral staircase, with fibers arranged in a twisting, helical pattern. The arapaima fish scale has many of these spiral staircases arranged next to each other. This arrangement makes the scales strong, flexible, and resistant to cracking. If a piranha attacks a fish without scales like these, it’s teeth would easily crack its scales and allow the piranha to penetrate the soft body of the fish underneath. However when an arapaima fish is bitten by a piranha, the Bouligand structure helps distribute the attack from the teeth by allowing the force to travel through these “spiral staircases”. This spreads out the force of the attack over a larger area,  helping to relieve the impact. During an attack, there may be a small crack in the fish scale, but the Bouligand structure keeps the small crack from growing large enough that the piranha’s teeth can break through.\nThe arrangement of the collagen in this ‘spiral staircase’ is the reason the Amazonian fish scales are so tough to crack. Understanding this design could lead to the invention of lightweight materials for armor that protects against explosions, or stronger frames for cars.\nThe hard and soft layers in the scales work together to provide a resilient barrier that can endure a predator attack with almost no damage, making these scales some of the toughest on Earth. The secret to these scales is in how these two layers are attached. The layers are connected by collagen, a connective tissue found in all animals. In humans, collagen in the skin helps it stay firm and elastic. In the arapaima fish scales, collagen connects the hard, outer layer to the soft inner layer in an important pattern called the Bouligand structure. This structure has also been found in the shells of lobsters, beetles, and crabs and is the key to what makes these shells so strong."}, {"Source": "coral's fluorescent proteins", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "act as antioxidants", "Function2": "keep free radicals at bay", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fluorescent-proteins-facilitate-healing/", "Strategy": "Fluorescent Proteins Facilitate Healing\n\nFluorescent proteins in some corals may play a role in the host stress response by acting as antioxidants.\n\n“When a coral is broken or wounded, it releases highly reactive atoms of oxygen known as free radicals to close up the gashes..But [free radicals] can also inadvertently kill off some of the coral’s healthy cells.

When food is limited, animals need to conserve their energy until food is readily available again. One way to conserve energy is to exert less throughout the day and/or night. Because all major life functions (breathing, moving, pumping blood, maintaining body temperature, etc) require energy, reducing body temperature or slowing heart rate is one way to conserve energy. Many animals do this during hibernation, but other animals, such as birds, do this for shorter periods of time (anywhere from 24 hours to a few days), which is known as torpor.\nMany birds enter torpor when it is difficult to hunt for prey and find food, for example during moonless and/or cloudy nights, when ambient light levels are low. The birds that most commonly engage in torpor are small-bodied specialized foragers, such as hummingbirds. Although there is considerable variation in patterns of torpor among birds, one species, the common poorwill (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii), is the only bird known to remain torpid for extended periods of time. Poorwills feast mainly on insects, and experience substantial seasonal fluctuations in food availability, and thus are much less active in the winter. To cope with the decrease in energy availability, common poorwills reduce their body temperature during winter, entering a hibernation-like state.

For desert plants, the right amount of water could take months or years to arrive, so some seeds become dormant. Their seed coats become impermeable to water, which appears to be contradictory if a seed needs to absorb water to germinate. However, imagine what disaster could befall a plant population if its seeds respond to any water event that comes along, or even just temporary high humidity.\n\nSeeds of several members of the Legume family have a valve that adjusts to changes in humidity while the rest of the seed coat remains impermeable. The hilar valve or hilum is the scar where the seed once attached to the parent plant. The valve allows water vapor to enter and exit to maintain a safe internal moisture level, but does not allow liquid water to pass. If humidity levels suddenly drop, stay low, then suddenly rise again, the valve doesn’t allow moisture back in. Essentially, the hilum then acts as a one-way valve, not allowing moisture in when humidity levels are high, but letting moisture out as humidity levels decrease. However, if humidity levels gradually rise to a high enough level, the hilar valve stays open and eventually allows liquid water to enter to the point when germination can occur if the seed is immersed in water.\n\nDifferent types of cells control the hilar valve. Columnar-shaped cells on either side of the opening and outside the impermeable layer, called counter palisade cells, are hygroscopic—they absorb water molecules from the atmosphere. When external humidity levels are high, they swell and close the valve, preventing water absorption into the seed. When humidity levels are low, they shrivel, causing the valve to open, allowing the seed to dry out more. Other cells, palisade epidermis cells, that control the hilar valve are found in a layer lining the inside of the seed coat’s impermeable layer. There is a certain amount of moisture tension between these cells and the counter palisade cells on the other side of the impermeable layer. For the hilum to close, this tension needs to exceed some minimum level. If while the hilar valve is open (i.e., at low relative humidity) there is a sudden increase in humidity, the tension reaches that minimum level and the hilum closes, preventing moisture from entering. If, however, there is a gradual rise in humidity, which signals the coming of suitable germination and growing conditions, the tension level never gets met, and the hilum stays open, allowing moisture to continue entering.\n\nWe can learn from clovers and lupines how to regulate moisture levels for buildings, packaging, bandages, and clothing. A building, for example, could have a breathing skin or envelope that self-adjusts to humidity levels, differences in temperature, atmospheric pressure, or liquids. A breathing building could result in healthier indoor air quality and moisture levels, creating a more comfortable and productive work space."}, {"Source": "rice plant's momilactone b", "Application": "plant compounds", "Function1": "suppress growth", "Function2": "protect against competitors", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/plant-compounds-protect-from-competitors/", "Strategy": "Plant Compounds Protect From Competitors\n\nCompounds in rice plants protect the plant from competitors by suppressing growth in competing plants\n\nMany plants naturally produce chemicals to defend against microbial and insect attack, and to compete with other plants that grow nearby. “Allelopathy” is the production and release of a chemical by one organism that is either detrimental or beneficial to another organism.\n\nAllelopathic varieties of rice (Oryza sativa) produce a compound known as momilactone B when growing near an agricultural weed called barnyard grass. Enzymes in allelopathic rice synthesize momilactones, which support the rice crop’s success by suppressing the growth of barnyard grass and other weeds. The exact mechanism by which momilactone B suppresses competing plants is still being uncovered. Current research indicates that the allelopathic compound negatively affects metabolic processes and reactions needed for the synthesis of cellular components in the competing plants.\n\nGrowing allelopathic varieties of rice and other crop plants could reduce the use of agricultural chemicals.

It’s almost as long as the weevil’s 0.4-inch (1-cm) body, and it extends straight outward, then gradually curves 90 degrees downward.\n\nAt the snout’s end are sharp mandibles that scissor into an acorn’s hard shell. The weevil raises its forelegs, tilts its head to apply downward pressure, and rotates around the hole, using the snout as a drill. While the weevil sucks up nutrients through the snout’s hollow center, it excavates a thin, straight chute into the acorn’s depths, into which the insect will later deposit eggs that hatch into larvae.\n\nDuring the excavation process, the curved part of the snout straightens, bending to the brink under the strain, but it does not break. When the weevil withdraws its snout, it instantly flexes back into its curved shape, no worse for wear.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe secret lies in the complex composite material that the snout is made of. It consists of tough fibers of chitin embedded in a matrix of proteins. This material is arranged in thin layers that align like steps in a spiral staircase. Each layer’s outer edge is rotated slightly forward from the one below it, so that they cumulatively form a helix.\n\nIn general, the long fibers best withstand breaking when pressure comes at them from the direction parallel to their length. Their strength diminishes, and the risk of breaking mounts, when force comes in from other angles. But scientists think that a confluence of factors work together to keep the material strong and flexible. The small angle differences between adjacent layers, their tightly packed spacing, and the broad spectrum of fiber directions encircling it combine to absorb and distribute incoming force through many layers, so that no one layer bears the brunt of an impact.\n\nIn addition, the multi-sided, multi-angled helical structure ensures that any cracks that do form between layers will hit a wall and have to change directions, unable to propagate far along a path of least resistance. In the same way, any multiple tiny cracks that form will be stymied from coalescing into long, wide ruptures.\n\nThe thickness of the chitin fibers also plays a role in changing the materials’ properties. The more brittle outer layer of the snout, called the exocuticle, has fibers measuring nanometers in diameter, while the inner layer, called the endocuticle, has fibers that are 1,000 times thicker, making it much stronger. The endocuticle gets progressively thicker down the length of the snout to fortify the areas where the snout must be able to bend under extreme pressure without breaking.\nIf the snout were to shatter under the repeated, extreme stress of drilling, it would mean death to the weevil and its future generations. How can this slim, seemingly fragile snout be so strong and yet so flexible?\n\nThe Potential\n\nIn general, the properties that make materials rigid and strong are the opposite of those that make materials flexible and fracture-resistant. Scientists are investigating the intricacies of weevil snout microstructure to design materials that optimally balance both properties in a variety of combinations that suit different uses.\n\nSuch materials would be a boon for a wide range of products, including ships, cars, airplanes, buildings, textiles, packaging, housewares, medical devices, and replacements for plastics—all of which must be strong, flexible, and unbreakable in the face of turbulence, pressure, earthquake shaking, and other forces that can bring them to a breaking point.

Gorging themselves, young gilas can consume half their body weight in a single sitting. In order to extract maximum energy from the glucose such meals can yield, the hardy reptiles need to keep their pancreases producing insulin over extended periods of time. Such an ability could be a great help for diabetics.\n\nGilas might be best known for having a potentially deadly venomous bite, but their legacy may actually be for saving human lives, not endangering them.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen you ingest carbohydrates from things like bread, fruits, vegetables, and dairy, your blood sugar (glucose) rises. In order for your body to turn it into energy, this sugar has to enter your cells from your blood stream. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, increases in your blood stream as soon as glucose appears. In type-I diabetics, the body prevents itself from producing enough insulin to do its job.\n\nInsulin tells your cells to open up and accept the glucose inside. Once in your cells, glucose can be converted into energy for immediate use or stored for use later. You’re using glucose right now, just to have the energy to read these words.\n\nWithin minutes of eating, your body produces another molecule, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1), which signals your pancreas to start producing insulin. Supplemental GLP1 would therefore be a good candidate for treating diabetes, except for the fact that it lasts only minutes before enzymes in our bodies break it back down. Ideally, a GLP1-like substance might be discovered which our enzymes didn’t break down so quickly, so that it could boost insulin production more effectively in diabetics.\n\nThe Potential\n\n Such a substance, exendin-4, was discovered in 1992 in the gila monster, after a researcher noticed the gila’s venom caused the pancreas of bitten victims to swell. In the human body, exendin-4 mimics the insulin-promoting action of GLP1, but it isn’t susceptible to our bodies’ GLP1-destroying enzymes. Synthetic peptides identical to exendin-4 are now used by diabetics around the world, helping them produce adequate levels of insulin and enjoy normal, healthy lives."}, {"Source": "mammal fur", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "dries fur", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fur-dries-by-shaking/", "Strategy": "Fur Dries by Shaking\n\nFur of mammals is optimally dried by changing shaking frequency.\n\nGetting wet is a fact of life for furry mammals, but it can be very dangerous to stay that way. Wet fur conducts heat, increasing the risk of hypothermia and the problem exists for animals of all sizes. Mice are small and have a relatively high surface area to volume ratio, meaning they lose heat very quickly, while for larger animals like polar bears their hunting habits and regional climate make getting dry quickly very important. A medium-sized dog, like a labrador, would use 1/5th of its daily calorie intake to offset the energy lost through air drying. To get around this problem, furry mammals shake.\n\nShaking is a surprisingly finely tuned process. Because shaking costs energy, mammals shake at exactly the frequency that achieves the maximum return on their energy investment. Small water droplets stick to fur and are very difficult to dislodge, while large droplets fall off easily. Animals shake at a speed calibrated to remove the larger droplets, getting rid of more than 70% of the water on their fur in seconds. In this way, they do not waste energy attempting to dislodge tiny water droplets that will evaporate quickly anyway.\n\nShaking is a rotation around the central axis of the body that works like a centrifuge to fling water away from the fur. Because the fur travels in an arc, the distance travelled and the amount of force generated during one shake depends on the size of the animal. Larger animals move their fur further and generate more force than smaller animals. To compensate, small animals shake at a higher frequency.\n\nFurry mammals tend to have loose skin. At the end of one shake, when the animal stops and begins to twist in the opposite direction, the skin continues moving. Once it reaches its full extent, the skin is snapped back by the body that is already moving very quickly back the other way. This snap generates very high forces on the water droplets that make shaking as much as three times more energy efficient than with tight skin."}, {"Source": "milkweed's chemical signaling system", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from predator", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/compounds-protect-against-predators/", "Strategy": "Compounds Protect Against Predators\n\nThe chemical signaling system of milkweed defends against predators by use of terpene compounds\n\n“As the largest class of natural products, terpenes have a variety of roles in mediating antagonistic and beneficial interactions among organisms.

This means it is more energetically favorable for the water to remain as microscale droplets, which easily roll off the surface, than for it to penetrate the air layer and spread out.\n\nThis mechanism for repelling water is similar to that found on other biological textured surfaces (like lotus leaves); however, because the spaces between the nanoscale bumps on mosquito ommatidia are smaller, the mosquito eye can ward off the tiny droplets of water that make up fog."}, {"Source": "insect's adhesive feet", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "self-clean efficient", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/adhesive-foot-pads-self-clean/", "Strategy": "Adhesive Foot Pads Self‑Clean\n\nAdhesive hairy foot pads on insects self-clean more efficiently than smooth pads because hair tips reduce the area for particle attachment.\n\nAn insect’s adhesive feet are critical to its ability to move around, climbing on vertical surfaces and hanging upside down while finding food or evading predators. Unlike most man-made adhesives, however, insect feet can attach and detach from a surface many times and still remain functional, even while encountering contaminants like dirt, pollen, and flaky wax from leaf surfaces. How do their sticky feet stay clean?\n\nThere are two main kinds of foot pads among insects: smooth foot pads, like those found on grasshoppers, ants, and stick insects; and hairy foot pads, like those found on beetles and flies. Smooth foot pads have even and soft surfaces, while hairy foot pads are covered with bristles that range from microns to millimeters long. Both kinds of foot pads secrete fluids that aid in adhesion, which depends on the amount of contact between the foot surface and the substrate: the lower the contact area between the two—for instance because contaminating particles are covering the foot—the lower the adhesion. Both kinds of foot pads can also self-clean by walking. Stepping on a substrate removes contaminating particles from the feet when those particles are more attracted to the substrate than the feet. When it comes to self-cleaning, however, hairy foot pads appear to have a leg up on smooth ones.\n\nSmooth foot pads seem to require a shear force (parallel to the surface, as a brushing movement would be) to remove particles from the feet, but hairy foot pads can shed contaminating particles even when the foot just lifts up from the substrate (perpendicular to it). Based on models of hairy adhesive systems, it appears that hairs are easier to clean because their tips have inherently small surface areas; a contaminating particle attached to a narrow tip needs to move only slightly to the side for it to encounter empty space and disengage. While some particles could get stuck on the sides or between setae, on average, more particles are likely to be shed from hairy foot pads than from smooth foot pads. Furthermore, the hairs’ small surface area raises the likelihood that contaminating particles will be more attracted to the external substrate the insect is walking on, rather than its foot. Smooth and soft foot pads, on the other hand, can deform around a contaminating particle, increasing the contact between the two. As a result, hairy foot pads seem to recover from contamination much faster than smooth foot pads."}, {"Source": "thomson's gazelle's carotid rete", "Application": "human habitations", "Function1": "cool brain", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/carotid-rete-cools-brain/", "Strategy": "Carotid Rete Cools Brain\n\nThe carotid rete of the Thomson's gazelle cools its brain via counter-current heat exchange.\n\nThe Thomson’s gazelle lives in the East African savannah where is it exposed to high temperatures and predation by big cats, like the cheetah, lion, or leopard. These gazelles have been recorded to run at up to 43-50 miles per hour. Such a burst of speed may raise the metabolic rate, and thus heat production, by as much as 40 fold. Dissipating such heat loads is difficult, especially in arid environments where water is scarce and an animal needs to avoid losing too much through evaporative cooling.\n\nThe brain is a part of the body that is particularly sensitive to high temperature. Hence some ungulates, like the Thomson’s gazelle, use a counter-current heat exchanging structure known as the carotid rete to keep the brain cooler than the body. The rete is a configuration of arteries and veins in a sinus at the base of the brain. Warm blood flowing to the brain travels from the carotid artery into a network of small arteries within the sinus, where it transfers some of its heat to cooler venous blood flowing the opposite direction as it returns from the nasal passages. The cooled arterial blood then continues toward the brain.\n\nIn the running Thomson’s gazelle, body temperature rises more than brain temperature such that a difference between brain and body temperature has been measured at 2.7° C. A predator like the cheetah must stop running when its body and brain temperature reaches 40.5° C, but the gazelle can keep running as its body temperature rises above 43° without its brain temperature exceeding 40.5°. The ability to keep a cool head can thus give the gazelle a survival edge in these predatory pursuits as he can outlast the cheetah who cannot maintain a cooler brain.\n\nCounter-current heat exchangers can be found in many organisms in many configurations.

Different organisms use different materials as their shields, but the underlying pattern of hard protecting soft is consistent. A small number of animals use the reverse of this strategy, however: turtles, alligators and armadillos all have a hard shield with a soft skin outer layer.\n\nTurtle shells are living parts of the animal.

The soft skin is particularly useful for protecting against small scale indentation injuries, for example, like those from teeth when a predator attempts to bite the animal.

For mammals, wet tears are one strategy that helps to protect the eye from foreign particles, but they also have another strategy: eyelashes. Despite their filter-like bristled appearance, eyelashes don’t function like typical filters that trap debris. Instead, they project away from the eye’s sensitive surface and alter the flow of incoming air that may be carrying foreign particles.\n\nSimulations of airflows around eyes with no lashes, long lashes, and intermediate length lashes show that eye surfaces with lashes of an intermediate length should experience weaker flows. Without lashes, there is nothing to shield the eye from incoming airflows that can deposit foreign particles onto the eye. As lashes are added, they redirect the incoming airflow to create a region of stagnant air just above the eye’s surface. This layer of stagnant air has weaker flows, which leads to fewer airborne particles landing on the eye’s surface. Very long lashes, however, project so far into incoming airflow that they begin to direct high-speed flows toward the eye’s surface. The result of these opposing effects is that eyelashes with a length that is approximately one-third the eye width appear to produce the weakest airflows. This ratio of lash length to width seems to match with eyelash measurements in many different species of mammals.\n\nEyelashes redirecting airflows around eyes constitute a passive mechanism to help keep the eye surface clean. This mechanism may also function in insects, where ocular hairs that project from between eye facets appear to reduce airflow at the eye surface.

The periostracum also appears to protect the mussel from smaller settling organisms. The shell’s surface topography consists of a repeating pattern of ripples ~1-2 μm wide and ~1.5 μm tall. In experiments, the intact intertidal mussel shells had the lowest level of fouling compared to other species of bivalves with either smooth or more randomly structured shell surfaces, synthetic molds of mussel shells, and smooth and sanded synthetic surfaces. Furthermore, the mussel shell has a high level of fouling release (ease of removal) for organisms that do end up attaching to the shell. Researchers studying various shell surfaces and their microtopographies found that the “waviness” (overall texture) of the surface correlates with both fouling resistance and fouling release.\n\nThe exact mechanism by which the blue mussel’s surface structure deters attachment is being studied, but the leading hypothesis is that the space between surface ridges is small enough that most fouling organisms cannot attach properly.

Its stipe has a flexible joint at its base that enables it to fold over and be pulled by flowing water, instead of bent. In general, if a structure is long and skinny, it will experience less stress under tension (pulling) than in bending, especially if the structure is solid.

Hatchling leatherbacks have a conventional reptilian tracheal structure with circular cartilaginous rings interspersed with extensive connective tissue. The adult trachea is an almost continuous ellipsoidal cartilaginous tube composed of interlocking plates, and will collapse easily in the upper part of the water column during dives, thus avoiding pressure-related structural and physiological problems.

Being only about 0.2 to 0.3 mm thick, these scales are surprisingly tough. They can stop about 3 Newtons (comparatively, a Newton is the weight of an apple falling from a tree) of force from penetrating them. This is achieved with a two-layered structure. Each scale is composed of two equally thick layers: an outer bony layer that’s highly mineralized for sturdy outer protection, and an inner collagen layer that’s softer and less mineralized.\n\nThese two layers work together to prevent the soft body tissues beneath the scales from being punctured. When a predator catches a striped bass in its mouth and starts to bite, the bony layer is the first layer of defense. Able to withstand about 2 Newtons of force, the bony layer withstands most of the biting power. With more bite strength from the predator, the scale cracks in half lengthwise and widthwise, creating four “flaps.” The distribution of forces along the cracks between the flaps helps minimize damage to the underlying soft collagen layer. As the bite continues through the scale, the flaps are pushed down and the lower collagen layer separates from the upper bony layer. While the flaps are being pushed down and continue to contact the collagen layer, they help redistribute the bite forces over their larger area. This results in less damage to the soft collagen layer than if the forces were concentrated at the puncture site. The flaps are so helpful that they increase the overall impact resistance of the scales by 1 Newton.\n\nThe collagen layer also helps resist the bite through the orientation of its fibers. Lying at right angles to each other, the fibers of the collagen layer stretch under pressure. This is similar to how a woven hammock can hold a person, but a bunch of ropes all lying in the same direction cannot. This stops the tooth of the predator from immediately puncturing through. The detachment of the collagen layer from the bony layer also helps, as the predator has to bite further into the organism to penetrate the scale and reach the body tissues underneath. The scales cover most of the striped bass’ body and partially overlap, providing additional protection through extra layers.\n\nCompared to human-made protective covers, this two-layer scale system is surprisingly tough.

A gas-filled float at the stipe’s other end holds numerous photosynthetic blades close to the water’s surface.

A bull kelp stipe can be stretched 40% percent of its length before breaking, absorbing energy as it stretches. Thus, kelp requires about the same amount of energy to break as wood or insect cuticle does, although it resists breaking through being extensible rather than being strong and stiff.

This protects the cells from rupturing. The amount of shape change permitted depends on the angle between the fiber and the cell’s long axis: the smaller the fiber angle, the greater the cell width can change for any change in the cell’s length. Vascular plants typically have an average fiber angle of 20˚, whereas bull kelp has an average fiber angle of 60˚.

Tree species with rough, dense foliage and light colored leaves provide the greatest cooling benefits to their surroundings.\n\nDuring the day, the sun warms the earth as waves of sunlight are absorbed by all that it touches. When sunlight falls on trees, the energy excites atoms in its leaves, triggering photosynthesis and creating heating. Too little heat results in very slow growth, but excess heat can be destructive to temperature sensitive molecules in the plant. Tree species are adapted to their local sunlight regime by producing leaves with varying degrees of reflectiveness; i.e., dark colored leaves absorb the most energy from sunlight, while light colored leaves reflect excess sunlight. For example, conifer forests cover high latitudes where sunlight is limited. By having dark needles, conifers are able to absorb the most energy from sunlight when it is available. In contrast, cacti receive plenty of sunlight in low latitude deserts. To prevent scorching, cacti are light colored to reflect some of the sunlight they receive.\n\nSunlight also heats the ground where it is exposed, causing it to collect the sun’s energy during the day and release the energy as heat at night. This results in an overall heat increase in exposed areas because nighttime cooling is minimized. Shade trees with dense foliage are able to block sunlight from reaching the ground during the day, preventing the ground from collecting energy. Because shaded areas do not release heat at night, ambient temperatures remain cooler on average than exposed areas receiving the same amount of sunlight.\n\nIn addition to general heating, the energy from sunlight also excites water molecules in leaves and transforms them from liquid to vapor, a process called evapotranspiration. Water molecules are unique because they are able to hold a great deal of energy without releasing it as heat. In the vapor state, water molecules have a pronounced cooling effect because they are able to absorb heat from objects they come in contact with, including trees, the ground, and the human body. To maximize this cooling effect, some trees are adapted to allow the greatest amount of evapotranspiration to occur by producing leaves with high surface area. Rough leaves have more surface area than smooth leaves, providing more space for evapotranspiration across the surface of the leaf to occur. This results in greater cooling benefits due to the high humidity surrounding trees with rough leaves."}, {"Source": "clownfish's mucus coat", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from sea anemone's sting", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/mucus-coat-protects-from-sea-anemone/", "Strategy": "Mucus Coat Protects From Sea Anemone\n\nThe mucus coat of clownfish protects the fish from sea anemone's sting via innate or acquired immunity.\n\nClownfish and sea anemones have a complex and mutually beneficial relationship.

Studies have suggested that the clownfish’s protection can be innate, acquired, or both, depending upon the species. It is suggested that some species of clownfish are innately protected from an anemone’s sting before ever coming into contact with the anemone. This is because the mucus coat they produce is sufficient to protect them from the anemone’s sting. Others, however, must acclimate to the host anemone before they can move freely among its tentacles without being stung.

For many species, bulbous stems and alternating ridges are critical parts of this survival kit.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe peaks-and-troughs pattern that encircles the thick stems or branches of many cacti work in several ways to protect cacti from getting too hot and dry. For starters, the peaks provide shade for the troughs, reducing the amount of solar heat that gets into them.\n\nBut that doesn’t prevent cacti from still absorbing a lot of heat, so the ribs help in another way. Because the troughs are shaded, the air in them is cooler. It can then absorb more heat from the body of the cactus than warmer air could. As it warms, the air rises out of the troughs, upward to the peaks, where winds waft it away.\n\nAdditionally, the bumpy ribs disrupt airflow around cacti much more than if the cacti’s surfaces were smooth. That allows more airflow to whip away more heat. And a surface with many folds has much more surface area than a flat one of the same diameter, so the ribs also offer more surface area to dissipate heat.\n\nTo conserve scant water, cactus ribs have another secret at work. Plants in general have pores called stomata, usually located in leaves, through which water can evaporate, carrying heat with it, and cooling down the plants. Cacti cannot afford to lose much water, so the sun-drenched peaks of the ribs have fewer and smaller stomata than the shaded troughs.\n\nFinally, when the heat and sun of the desert give way to rainfall, cacti’s folded surfaces transform. As the plant takes in refreshment, the ribs and troughs can unfold, expanding sort of like an accordion to store the watery bounty.\n\nThe Potential\n\nArchitects have already been incorporating cactus-inspired designs into buildings—particularly in hot, dry regions—to reduce the amount of heat absorbed by building surfaces and/or maximize the heat they can radiate.

Simultaneously, the tree bark is highly absorbing and thus radiation emitting between 6 and 10 [microns].

The second condition, optimal emission at a temperature that the object reaches (approximately 40 ºC) has also been demonstrated here. Barks, through tannin and cellulose, efficiently absorb radiation between 6 and 10 [microns] (Figs. 10, top and 12), which means that they emit radiation equally well in this wavelength region. It allows efficient thermal emission into the cool space via an optical atmospheric window between 7.5 and 13 [microns] (Fig. 6). Since leaves also have to cool down efficiently and therefore also have to emit radiation in this infrared optical window, it can be speculated that cellulose and tannins have been evolved, adopted, and applied because of their radiation properties. This could have been at least one of several evolutionary factors. As already mentioned the optical properties of tree barks are of course not the only factor that has been considered by evolution with respect to the heat balance of the tree bark. Many tree barks show a paper-like structure with sheets peeling off, generating highly heat-insulating, trapped air spaces between them (e.g. birch, paper-bark tree). Other tree barks have developed a very rough surface that produces a lot of shadowed areas amongst the illuminated ones [11]. Such a morphology is known to stimulate convection of air, which then transports away heat from the bark surface. An additional fact or that has been considered by evolution was, as already mentioned, the structure of tree stems and branches.

An example of outstanding impact resistance is the pummelo fruit (Citrus maxima) which can drop from heights of 10 m and more without showing significant outer damage. Our data suggest that this impact resistance is due to the hierarchical organization of the fruit peel, called pericarp.” \n\n“Citrus maxima is the largest fruit among the genus Citrus with a fruit weight up to 6 kg and a maximal height of the fruit bearing trees of 15 m. In combination these two factors, fruit weight and the height of the fruit bearing branches, cause a high potential energy of the hanging fruit. After the fruit is shed its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which reaches its maximum just before impact with the ground. If the high kinetic energy was to cause the pummelos to split open when impacting with the ground, the fruits would perish within a short time due to the tropical climate in Southeast Asia, the region of origin of the genus Citrus.” \n\n“Semi-quantitative analyses of thin sections of pummelo peel revealed a gradual transition in density between exocarp and mesocarp. Thus, structurally, the dense exocarp cannot be separated clearly from the spongy mesocarp. We hypothesize that due to this lack of an abrupt change in tissue composition and therefore in structural and mechanical properties the risk of delamination of the tissues during impact is reduced. The impact force acting on the pummelo depends on the velocity of the fruit before impact and its weight, but also on the consistency of the ground. Under natural conditions, part of the total energy is dissipated by the relatively pliable ground, as typically existing in the regions where pummelos grow naturally. In the tests presented mechanical loads acting on the fruits were increased by dropping the fruits onto a hard ground. Thus all kinetic energy must have been dissipated by the fruits themselves. The mesocarp with its air-filled intercellular spaces represents a compressible foam. As the Young’s modulus of this spongy part of the peel is rather low, we conclude that its ability to dissipate large amounts of energy must result from the structural composition of the peel.” "}, {"Source": "wood frog's blood", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from freezing temperature", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/compounds-protect-from-freezing/", "Strategy": "Compounds Protect From Freezing\n\nCompounds, such as sugar, in the blood of wood frogs protect them from freezing temperatures by affecting how water freezes in the body.\n\n“The North American wood frog (Rana sylvatica), for instance, can survive freezing temperatures for as long as seven months, relying on a natural antifreeze in its blood to protect its organs.”"}, {"Source": "acacia tree's leaves", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "produce cyanogenic poison", "Function2": "release ethylene gas", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/cyanogenic-poison-protects-from-herbivores/", "Strategy": "Cyanogenic Poison Protects From Herbivores\n\nThe leaves of acacia trees protect from being eaten by producing a cyanogenic poison.\n\n“The African acacias, well-protected though they may be by their thorns, use distasteful chemicals in their leaves as a second line of defence.

Penguins are unusual in that their feathers are not arranged in tracts, as in other birds, but instead are evenly packed over their surface.

A newly discovered strategy shows that elephants aren’t always so thick-skinned after all.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nOne way that elephants lower their body temperatures is by bathing in water. That provides an immediate cool-down, but there’s more to it. The intricate pattern of wrinkles and crevices in their skin traps water, which evaporates and transfers heat into the air—much the way sweating cools us down.\n\nAnother major strategy to cool down is called vasodilation. When we get too hot, our blood vessels widen and bring more warm blood from our cores to our skin surface. That’s why our faces sometimes flush pink when we exercise. Vasodilation cools us down in two ways: First, it enables heat to radiate out of the body and into the air. That heat also speeds up evaporation of water in the form of sweat escaping through skin pores, which cools us down.\n\nBarrel-bodied elephants need a lot of water and can’t afford to lose any via sweating. But they can still use vasodilation to dissipate heat through their skin.  Elephant ears (the real ones, not the pastries) are ideal for this. They provide wide platforms of relatively thin skin filled with blood vessels. When elephants get too hot, they flood their ears with blood to dissipate body heat. They also can fan their ears to increase airflow over their skin to lose heat faster.\n\nRecently, however, scientists have discovered that elephants also use vasodilation in several other areas around  their bodies. “Thermal windows” are networks of tiny blood vessels that rise right near the surface of the elephants’ 1-inch- (2.5-cm-) thick skin. Theys can’t be seen with the naked eye, but cameras that visualize heat have revealed them to scientists. These hot spots may also help indirectly, by bringing more heat to the skin to enhance evaporation of the water trapped in their wrinkles.\n\nThe opposite of all this is also true. When elephants get too cold, their vasodilation adjusts accordingly, and the thermal windows in their skin can be “closed” to help retain heat and finely regulate overall body temperature.\n\nThe Potential \n\nEngineers are already designing real windows for buildings with bio-inspired, fluid-filled circulatory systems that can regulate how much heat the windows radiate or absorb. Similar systems could be designed for other construction materials for buildings or cars, for example, or textiles for clothing, bedding, and outdoor gear such as tents. There is also potential for medical devices to help people with difficulties regulating body temperature, such as those facing thyroid problems or menopause.\n"}, {"Source": "elephant's large ears", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "aid cooling", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/large-ears-aid-cooling/", "Strategy": "Large Ears Aid Cooling\n\nThe large ears of elephants aid cooling by radiating heat from blood vessels, and flapping to generate cooling air currents.\n\n"}, {"Source": "mollusks' byssus thread", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "resist forces", "Function2": "resist hydrodynamic force", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/byssus-threads-resist-forces/", "Strategy": "Byssus Threads Resist Forces\n\nThe byssus threads of mollusks are strong anchors that can resist hydrodynamic forces because of mechanically distinct regions within each thread.\n\n“One particular use of a collagenous rope gives a sense of the range of performance nature can get from this material–and of some of the peculiarities of applying data from standard analyses. As familiar to anyone who has poked around rocky, wave-swept shores, mussels don’t dislodge easily. Each is attached to rocks by twenty to sixty stringy byssus threads of sufficient tenacity to resist extreme hydrodynamic forces. (Denny [1988] provides an especially good view of the origin of these forces.) At first glance, a collagenous material looks inappropriate for the mission. After all, low extensibility means that unless particularly well matched and faced with forces of invariant strength and direction, only some subset of threads will bear the load. Imagine hanging from a group of inextensible ropes each of slightly different length–having more than one will gain you nothing, since they’ll break one by one instead of sharing the load.\nA byssus thread contains two mechanically distinct regions, called, for their distance from the shell, proximal and distal. The material of both regions proves to be unusually extensible for collagens, which sounds right and proper. But then, according to Bell and Gosline (1996) things get more complex. The proximal region can be strained to a greater fraction of unloaded length, but it never achieves the breaking strength of the distal region, as you can see from figure 16.14a. So it looks as if their proximal regions take care of distributing the load among the threads. Not so. The distal region of threads happens to be two to four times longer and only half as wide. So a given force will stretch it quite far. Replotting the data as force against extension for a whole thread as a structure, as in figure 16.14b, shows a nice match. Even better, it shows how the distal thread yields (the horizontal portion of its curve) just short of the breaking force–an extension that will permit threads to reorient closer to the direction of the applied force and to share increasing loads among an increasing number of threads.”"}, {"Source": "african elephant's foot", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "distribute mechanical forces", "Function2": "store or absorb mechanical forces", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/foot-cushions-support-large-weight/", "Strategy": "Foot Cushions Support Large Weight\n\nThe foot of the African elephant absorbs and distributes mechanical forces by consisting of sheets or strands of fibrous connective tissue forming larger metacarpal/metatarsal and digital compartments and smaller chambers filled with adipose tissue.\n\n“The uniquely designed limbs of the African elephant, Loxodonta africana, support the weight of the largest terrestrial animal.

The high-speed pecking motion of the golden-fronted woodpecker causes a tremendous amount of stressed force on the animal. One mechanism that prevents physical and neurological trauma is the combination of the small volume of the woodpecker’s cranial space and the smooth surface area of the brain.Similar to mammals, bird skulls contain a space between the brain’s gray matter and the skull’s vascular tissue, called a subarachnoid cavity. The cavity houses cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that provides cushioning from minor bumps and jostling, as well as protection from diseases. However, CSF will not protect the brain from strong vibrations or blows, like those experienced by woodpeckers or football players. In these instances, CSF will allow excessive movement of the brain, potentially resulting in bruising and concussions.The woodpecker has proportionally less CSF than other birds, an adaptation to protect its brain during drumming. Less CSF combats the risk of brain injury in two ways. First, the decreased volume makes it more difficult for the brain to be disrupted if the head is struck. Second, with a decreased CSF volume, there is less medium for stress forces to transmit through, therefore reducing the impact on neural tissue.In addition to cavity volume, the surface area of the woodpecker brain is smooth with fewer pronounced peaks and valleys. Therefore, if the skull were to be struck, the impact would be more evenly transmitted around the brain, rather than hitting one point with a greater amount of force.\n\nThis illustration represents a species with a complex brain. The brain has a good number of peaks and valleys. When struck, the site of impact receives a greater amount of force due to its raised ridges. Illustration by Allison Miller.\n\nIn a smooth brained species, such as the golden-fronted woodpecker, the force is distributed more evenly, resulting in a decreased residual impact. Illustration by Allison Miller.\n\n"}, {"Source": "lotus seed", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent water and air from entering", "Function2": "repair enzymes resist attacks by fungi and help the seed survive harsh temperatures", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/seed-coat-and-enzymes-protect-seed/", "Strategy": "Seed Coat and Enzymes Protect Seed\n\nSeeds of lotus remain viable for thousands of years via hard seed coat and repair enzymes.\n\n“In the West, lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.) is relatively little known.

The fruits at Xipaozi, preserved in a dry ancient lakebed, have been exposed to low-dose γ-radiation for hundreds of years (having an accumulated soil irradiation of 0.1-1.0 Gy). Offspring from these old fruits show abnormalities that resemble those in various modern seedlings irradiated at much higher doses. Although these lotus offspring are phenotypically abnormal, the viability of old seeds was evidently not affected by accumulated doses of up to 3 Gy. Growth characteristics of first- and second-year lotus offspring of these fruits, products of the longest-term radiobiological experiment on record, are summarized here (rapid early growth, phenotypic abnormalities, lack of vigour, poor rhizome development and low photosynthetic activity during second-year growth). Aspects of their chromosomal organization, phenotype and physiology (rapid recovery from stress, heat-stable proteins, protein-repair enzyme) are discussed.

During drying of the chlorolichen Cladonia rangiformis and the cyanolichen Peltigera neckeri, chlorophyll fluorescence decreased and stable light-dependent charge separation in reaction centers of the photosynthetic apparatus was lost. The presence of light during desiccation increased loss of fluorescence in the chlorolichen more than that in the cyanolichen. Heating of desiccated Cladonia thalli, but not of Peltigera thalli, increased fluorescence emission more after the lichen had been dried in the light than after drying in darkness. Activation of zeaxanthin-dependent energy dissipation by protonation of the PsbS protein of thylakoid membranes was not responsible for the increased loss of chlorophyll fluorescence by the chlorolichen during drying in the light. Glutaraldehyde inhibited loss of chlorophyll fluorescence during drying. Desiccation-induced loss of chlorophyll fluorescence and of light-dependent charge separation are interpreted to indicate activation of a highly effective mechanism of photoprotection in the lichens. Activation is based on desiccation-induced conformational changes of a pigment-protein complex. Absorbed light energy is converted into heat within a picosecond or femtosecond time domain. When present during desiccation, light interacts with the structural changes of the protein providing increased photoprotection. Energy dissipation is inactivated and structural changes are reversed when water becomes available again. Reversibility of ultra-fast thermal dissipation of light energy avoids photo-damage in the absence of water and facilitates the use of light for photosynthesis almost as soon as water becomes available.” "}, {"Source": "resurrection fern's cell", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "survive extreme water loss", "Function2": "attract, sequester, and localize water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/cells-survive-extreme-water-loss/", "Strategy": "Cells Survive Extreme Water Loss\n\nThe cells of resurrection ferns may survive extreme water loss thanks to dehydrin proteins.\n\n“[S]ome plants, like the aptly named ‘resurrection fern’ (Polypodium polypodioides), can survive extreme measures of water loss, even as much as 95% of their water content.

The anti-erosion trend characteristics and mechanism of desert scorpion’s surface under the dynamic effects of gas/solid mixed media were studied, especially the comprehensive influence of surface morphology, microstructure, creature flexibility and many other factors were studied also. The results showed that erosion resistance of desert scorpion back is a result of multiple coupling effects. Surface morphology, material, and flexibility are biological coupling elements which play an important role in resisting erosion for the back of desert scorpion.” "}, {"Source": "tree's leaf", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "reduce exposure", "Function2": "limit flutter", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/weak-leaves-deal-with-strong-winds/", "Strategy": "Weak Leaves Deal With Strong Winds\n\nThe leaves of trees deal with strong winds by adjusting their configurations in order to reduce exposure and limit flutter.\n\n“Leaves–trees, really–have a problem, the same one as our solar panels.

Pine needles cluster instead of being splayed outward…The solution…involves two aspects as common in nature’s technology as they are rare in our own. First, shape isn’t held constant, but rather shape and the forces of flow interact complexly, each dependent on the other. The local wind forces on a leaf depend (in part) on its shape; its shape, in turn, depends (in part) on the local wind forces.

Their collapse during the time they are needed to function is prevented by specialised thickening in their walls. This takes on the form of a series of annuli, or of a spiral (helical) winding…The tracheids and vessels formed after extension growth is complete tend to have thick, rigid walls with either thin areas (pits), as in both tracheids and vessel elements, or clear openings between cells in line, as in vessel elements alone. These facilitate water movement from cell to cell. Even here, some of these cells in a range of species have an additional helical thickening on the inner side of their walls.”"}, {"Source": "vertebrate's joint", "Application": "lubricants", "Function1": "lubricate joints", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fluid-lubricates-joints/", "Strategy": "Fluid Lubricates Joints\n\nJoints of vertebrates are protected by use of a lubricant, synovial fluid.\n\n“Whereas technology tries to polish the hard metal of bearings to as fine a finish as possible, nature covers the touching surfaces with a spongelike substance which is comparatively stiff yet quite elastic: cartilaginous tissue, which differs from hard bone tissue essentially in that it lacks deposits of calcium crystals.

The hollow U-shaped section of the petiole and the longitudinal strengthening elements in its outer skin give it adequate rigidity, while its ventral curvature help support the leaf without the need for thick lateral veins. These features, however, also allow the petiole to reconfigure by twisting away from the wind, while the leaf can fold away. In addition, two sets of internal structures, longitudinal partitions and transverse stellate parenchyma plates, help prevent dorsoventral flattening, allowing the petiole to flex further away from the wind without buckling. These ideas were tested and verified by a range of mechanical tests. Simple four-point-bending and torsion tests showed that the petioles are indeed far more compliant in torsion than in bending.

Second, the surfaces meet in only two ways: either three surfaces merge along a curve (edge), or six surfaces at a vertex. Third, when surfaces come together at a curve, or curves and surfaces at a point, they do so at equal angles. These three principles allow bubbles to eliminate air space between their flexible membranes, thereby optimally packing spheres.” (Biomimicry Guild unpublished report)"}, {"Source": "pacific palolo worm's reproductive cycle", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "reproduce via lunar cycle detection", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/lunar-cycle-triggers-reproduction/", "Strategy": "Lunar Cycle Triggers Reproduction\n\nThe reproductive cycle of the Pacific palolo worm is synchronized via lunar cycle detection.\n\n“The Pacific palolo worm (Eunice viridis) and its West Indian relative (E. fucata) exhibit one of the most incredible examples of reproductive behavior on record, which is intimately linked to the lunar cycle. These two annelid species are polychaete worms, and normally remain secure within tubes excavated by them in coral or under rocks, with their heads at the open end of their tubes – until the breeding season, that is.\n\n“When this period approaches, the rear half of each worm transforms dramatically, developing fast-growing reproductive organs. The worm itself reverses its position within its tube, so that it is now pointing head-down, with its highly modified posterior half-projecting out of the tube. Once the reproductive organs are fully developed, the posterior body half breaks off from the rest of the worm (which remains inside its tube but realigns itself so that its head is at the tube’s open end again), and swims up toward the sea’s surface – almost as if it were a separate animal in its own right. Indeed, it has even developed a pair of eyes to assist it in locating the surface.\n\n“As it swims, the worm’s posterior body half undergoes a further transformation, its internal structures and segmentation breaking down, so that when it reaches the surface it is nothing more than a writhing bag of either sperm or eggs (the sexes are separate in these species). At the surface, the bag bursts, releasing its contents – and, bearing in mind that millions of palolo worms have all undergone this radical metamorphosis at precisely the same time, the sea is soon awash with a mass of sperm and eggs, yielding a vast bout of communal, random fertilization. What makes these worms’ reproductive behavior even more extraordinary is the exact nature of this event’s timing. It occurs twice a year on the neap tides of the last quarter moon in October and November for the Pacific species, and the third quarter moon in June and July for the West Indian species of palolo worm.” "}, {"Source": "microcolonial fungi", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from uv light", "Function2": "protect from desiccation", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/circular-tapering-beams-stabilize/", "Strategy": "Mycosporines Protect From UV Light, Desiccation\n\nCantilever-like structures such as long necks and antennae of many organisms stabilize via circular, tapering structure.\n\n“UV absorption of both mycosporines at 310 nm hints at their biological role as UV filters.

The degree of water remaining in different areas of the composite material is thought to contribute to the gradient of flexibility along the length of the beak – flexible where it is attached to the body and increasingly stiff towards the far end.

The nest structure was studied by excavating nests and making a cast of the galleries using polyurethane foam. The nests were quite extensive, normally with two elevated nest entrances and galleries down to depths of 45 cm. The loose soil particles at the nest entrances collapsed when the tide reached them and formed a stopper which prevented water from intruding into the nest. In this way, the galleries remained dry during high tide. The ants showed a clear swimming or “walking on the surface” behaviour when they returned to the nest just before the entrance collapsed and during ebb. The tolerance of the ants to submergence was tested in the laboratory, with 50% mortality after 11 hours submergence in seawater at 23o C, and only 3.5 hours in water at 33o C.

But the marine threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) has found a way to survive the onslaught of neighbors looking for a seafood dinner.\n\nThis 4-inch-long (10-cm) fish is found along coastlines throughout much of the northern hemisphere. It has not only spines but also dozens of overlapping plates of armor along its sides and a strong pelvic girdle to protect itself from harm. Together these structures use not one, but six different features to thwart attackers seeking the juicy meal inside.\n\nTogether these structures use not one, but six different features to thwart attackers seeking the juicy meal inside.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nFirst, rather than relying on a single type of protection, the armor uses both movable spines and fixed plates to provide both stability and flexibility to adapt to circumstances.\n\nEach plate also varies in thickness from one end to the other. That means that even though the plates overlap, they produce uniformly thick protection rather than leaving thinner, more vulnerable spots in the sections where just one plate is present\n\nThe plates have bumps and indentations that fit together where they overlap. This maintains the overall integrity of the armor while also allowing the plates to shift positions relative to each other as the fish moves.\n\nThe bottom-facing plates on the pelvic girdle interlink, creating a structure that’s flexible for easy movement when the fish is not threatened but can lock into a more rigid, protective position during an attack.\n\nThe individual lateral plates are layered, with a lightweight porous middle layer sandwiched between two denser surfaces. This helps make them stiff, strong, and lightweight all at the same time.\n\nFinally, the lateral plates have a bumpy outside surface. This not only may make the armor tougher to penetrate than a smooth surface would (perhaps by increasing surface area and causing the force of a predator’s bite to be distributed through the tissue), but also likely reduces drag and shear stress, allowing the fish to swim with minimal energy cost.\n\nInterestingly, in places where sticklebacks have spread inland to inhabit freshwater, the number of plates and density of minerals within them tend to decline. The adaptive value of this is not completely clear, but scientists speculate it may have to do with differences in predation, mineral availability, or other variables between the two types of environments.\n\nThe Potential\n\nEach of the six principles offers valuable insights for designing materials and products that resist abrasion, puncture, and other onslaughts. For instance, the texture of the surface of the plates can inform the construction of aircraft, watercraft, and motor vehicles, which need to be both durable and streamlined. Similarly, the sandwich-like configuration can inform the design of underground pipelines, which need to resist penetration by rocks but also be lightweight for transportation and installation. And the durability and flexibility offered by the interlocking plates might inspire new designs for helmets and other protective gear for sports.\n\nPerhaps the most important lessons of all have to do with the value of not putting all of one’s defensive eggs in one basket, and with adapting to circumstances. By combining a variety of strategies and adapting to different environments, the marine threespine stickleback can ward off a range of onslaughts from different predators at the least cost to itself—a valuable lesson in general for coping with an often unpredictable world."}, {"Source": "staghorn coral", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect against compression loading", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/structure-protects-against-compression-loading/", "Strategy": "Structure Protects Against Compression Loading\n\nThe structure of staghorn coral is just one example of a natural branched system that protects against compression loading using scaled struts joined in a common lattice.\n\n“In nature we notice trees, branching corals, and other fairly stiff items.

Our results show that the fracture toughness of cuticle in locust hind legs is 4.12 MPa m1/2 and decreases with desiccation of the cuticle. Stiffness and strength of the tibia cuticle were measured using buckling and cantilever bending and increased with desiccation. A combination of the cuticle’s high toughness with a relatively low stiffness of 3.05 GPa results in a work of fracture of 5.56 kJ m–2, which is amongst the highest of any biological material, giving the insect leg an exceptional ability to tolerate defects such as cracks and damage.

The plant, shown in figure 21.4, never reaches a meter in height, so it’s not exactly a big tree. But, like trees, it has three parts, an attachment (holdfast), a column (stipe), and photosynthetic laminae (fronds). It stands against gravity, getting higher in dense stands, and it bends in response to lateral force, for it, waves. Unlike any tree, though, it responds to lateral force by bending until almost prostrate and then springing back upright.

Regaining its erect posture depends on reinvesting that work of extension, which requires a high resilience, which it has. But, as Holbrook, Denny, and Koehl emphasized, the energy storage underlying that resilience undermines its toughness. Postelsia is notably brittle and sensitive to scratches–its stipe may be soft, but cracks propagate all too readily. Before dismissing this alga as just a lowly tree wannabe, bear in mind that it has extraordinarily high photosynthetic productivity and that it invests far more, proportionately, in photosynthetic organs than any ordinary tree. Its fronds represent no less than 38 percent of its energy content or 35 percent of its weight (Lawrence and McClintock 1988)–compare this with the trivial weight and burning yield of the annual leaf-fall of a tree that yields a cord or so (perhaps 2 metric tons) of dry firewood.” (Vogel 2003:434-435)\n\n“Sea-palms Postelsia palmaeformis Ruprecht are annual brown algae that grow on wave-swept rocky shores, often forming dense stands. Unlike most macroalgae, Postelsia stands upright in air–like trees. The stipe flexibility that permits Postelsia to withstand waves is provided by the low elastic modulus\n(5-10 MPa) of stipe tissue; in spite of the weakness (low breaking stress, ~ 1 MPa) of this tissue, a large amount of energy ( ~ 100 kJ/m 3) is required to break a stipe because they can be extended by 20-25 % before breaking. Although made of such easily deformed tissue, Postelsia can stand upright in air due to the width (high second moment of area) and resilience of their stipes, but the brittleness (low work of fracture, 400-900 J/m 2) that accompanies this resilience renders them susceptible to breakage if they sustain deep scratches. Although wave-induced stresses experienced by individuals in aggregations are not lower than those experienced by isolated sea-palms, photon flux densities of photosynthetically active radiation within these dense groves are less than 10% of those above Postelsia canopies. A number of morphological features differ between canopy, understory, and isolated individuals. Canopy plants in dense aggregations are taller than isolated individuals and may exceed limiting proportions for elastic stability. Postelsia shows photosynthetic characteristics of “shade-adapted” plants, understory individuals being especially effective at using low light. Despite this, blade growth rates of understory plants are lower than those of either canopy or isolated individuals.” "}, {"Source": "methanopyrus microbe's membrane", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "avoid melting", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/membranes-avoid-melting/", "Strategy": "Membranes Avoid Melting\n\nMembranes of Methanopyrus microbes avoid melting in high heat because they are made up of waxy chemicals instead of ordinary fats.\n\n“But hyperthermophiles still have waxy membranes, consist of proteins, and their genes are made of DNA; how do they manage to thrive in such heat?

Instead, thanks to a large impact early in Earth’s history (which probably resulted in the formation of our Moon), the Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5° with respect to the Sun. The result? For months on end, half of the Earth is tilted away from our local star, and winter besets that portion of the world.\n\nBut despite the bitter cold, life goes on, and  even species which couldn’t survive extended exposure to cold or freezing temperatures find ways to make such regions home. These residents include, perhaps most surprisingly, many species of ectotherms––organisms which generate little body warmth on their own and depend nearly entirely on external sources of heat to provide the energy for their bodies to function.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nMany ectotherms living in cold regions (including lizards, turtles, snakes, frogs, and salamanders) survive the wintertime by finding shelter underground. Not only are underground dens protected from the worst of winds , but in just a few feet, the Earth quickly provides a stable, relatively warm microclimate that can be dozens of degrees warmer than the air temperature at the surface. During one winter in Wisconsin, it was -2֯ F (-18֯ C) at the surface; two inches below the soil, the temperature was measured at 27֯ F (-2.7֯ C).\n\nThe Earth produces this heat from its own internal dynamics: friction from the movement of its core, the decay of radioactive atoms, and residual heat from the planet’s formation. While deep inside the temperatures and pressures are enough to keep rock in a molten state, in shallow caves and burrows in the transition zone between the planet’s inner heat and the atmosphere’s relative coolness, the temperature averages a comfortable 55֯ F (12֯ C).\n\nWherever winters occur, nearly every non-climbing, non-migrating species one sees during summer overwinters underground. Some, such as the Pacific rattlesnake, select overwintering dens whose depth increases with colder conditions. Rattlers will also select dens preferentially on south-facing slopes, which receive more sunlight than other slopes. Other species, such as the three-toed box turtle, actively dig their burrows deeper as surface temperatures get colder.\n\nThe Potential\n\nManaging temperature is a big concern for people, too. Humankind devotes 40% of its total energy use to controlling the temperature of its buildings, for instance.\n\nFossil fuels are typically used to heat air or water from ambient surface temperatures to room temperature, in order for people to live and work comfortably indoors. Meanwhile, just a few feet away, an enormous, free thermal resource sits untapped.\n\nBut increasingly, underground denning species, resourceful by necessity, are inspiring people to use the subsurface’s ambient temperatures to do the work of heating air and water for us. Because they use subsurface ground heat to bring air and water up to that average 55֯ F (12֯ C) at all times of year, “ground-source heat pump” systems deliver 400% as much energy as they require to run, compared with fossil fuel heating systems, which always deliver less heat (<100%) than they burn. Estimates are that these heat pumps could meet 90% of global building heating needs, at a fraction of the energy consumption or greenhouse gas production."}, {"Source": "dicranum moss", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "repel herbivorous slugs", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/compounds-repel-slugs/", "Strategy": "Compounds Repel Slugs\n\nTissues of Dicranum moss repel herbivorous slugs by responding to damage with chemical compounds called oxylipins.\n\n“[S]nails don’t like all plants in the same way — they shun moss.

By doing so, the plant creates a miniature ecosystem where the resources of warmth, humidity and nourishment are significantly better than in the world outside it. The cushion’s furry exterior acts like a muff, helping to hold any warmth it might contain. The plant may even add to that by, on occasion, expending a little of its food reserves in slightly raising the internal temperature. The sheer bulk of fibres of the cushion retains water like a sponge and the fierce winds do not dry it out. Nor is the nutriment embodied in the leaves lost when they die. Instead of being shed, they remain within the cushion and the upper part of the stems puts out lateral rootlets to reabsorb much of the leaves’ constituents just as soon as decay releases them…No plants develop bigger cushions than those growing on the tops of the mountains in Tasmania. They have a particular need to do so. Snow seldom falls on these peaks because the surrounding sea keeps the climate relatively mild.

The answer, in a word, is platelets. About one-fifth the size of the red blood cells that carry oxygen, these disc-shaped cells move into action to create a temporary patch when a blood vessel springs a leak.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWhen all is well, platelets simply flow through blood vessels alongside other cells and substances. But if a platelet encounters a protein on the wall of the blood vessel that indicates that the vessel has been injured, it springs into action and another protein on the surface of the platelet grabs onto the protein that’s signaling trouble.\n\nThat connection then triggers a series of changes within the platelet. The platelet forms octopus-like tentacles that extend its surface area. It flattens out like a pancake. It releases compounds that make it sticky and compounds that attract other platelets to join the effort. And its surface changes in a way that enables a stringlike material called fibrin to link it to these additional platelets. Within minutes, these many activities create a clot—a plug that closes the wound and reduces or stops the loss of blood.\n\nThe body’s ability to mobilize its blood-clotting forces when a blood vessel is breached without any conscious effort is critical to survival. People with a genetic mutation that prevents normal clotting can suffer life-threatening damage to internal tissues due to uncontrolled bleeding.\n\nAlso critical is the ability to prevent clotting when it’s not wanted. Sometimes platelets misread the signals, interpreting an irregularity in a blood vessel wall as an injury that needs repair. In such cases, clots can form within an intact vessel, blocking normal blood flow in a way that can injure or kill the organism. For the most part, however, the rapid transformation of inactive platelet cells to connected clumps that are able to stop blood flow serves as a literal life saver, providing a stopgap patch after injury until the blood vessel repair team arrives.\n\nThe Potential\n\nWith its ability to flow freely through the bloodstream under normal circumstances but also to identify a break and rapidly change form and function to create a temporary closure, platelets offer an inspiring model for preventing problems caused by breaching a barrier between a liquid and its environment.

These are very rich in protein and many of the plant-eating animals on the plain relish them. Those seeds that remain uneaten on the ground seldom if ever germinate, whereas those that are swallowed with the pods do. It used to be thought that this was because stewing in digestive juices weakened the covering of the seeds and made it possible for the infant plant within to break out. The truth, however, is somewhat different. Within a few hours of the acacia tree shedding its pods, large numbers of a particular kind of small beetle fly in, pierce the pods with their sharp ovipositors and lay their eggs within. The eggs hatch rapidly and the tiny grubs then proceed to feed on the acacia’s seeds. Unless, that is, the pods are eaten by an animal such as an elephant. Although the elephant grinds up the pods with its teeth, many of the seeds remain unharmed and are swallowed with the mash. In the stomach all the beetle eggs are killed stone dead by the digestive juices. So when the seeds finally return to the outside world with the animal’s droppings, they have been freed from their insect pests by the elephant, just as effectively as seeds of wheat that have been treated by a farmer with insecticide.”"}, {"Source": "spider's legs", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "prevent depressurization", "Function2": "seal joint", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/mechanism-to-seal-joint-prevents-depressurization/", "Strategy": "Mechanism to Seal Joint Prevents Depressurization\n\nThe legs of spiders are protected from depressurization when damaged via a joint sealing mechanism.\n\n“One particular hydraulic device is worth a little more attention here, partly because its existence comes as yet another surprise and partly because it achieves antagonism for contractile muscle in an unusual way. The eight legs of a spider differ little from the six of an insect, but a curious special feature of spider legs has been known for almost a century. While properly equipped with flexor muscles (ones that decrease the angle between one segment and another), they lack the antagonistic extensor muscles (ones that increase that angle toward 180 degrees). Biologists casually assumed that elasticity of the interarticular membranes provided the antagonistic force, not on the face of it an unreasonable idea. But Ellis (1944) remembered that spiders die with legs severely flexed. If elasticity did the extension, they would more likely die with legs extended or at least not so flexed–as do insects. He found that cutting off the tip of a leg prevented re-extenson until the tip was resealed; and he found that mild exsanguination reduced a spider’s ability to extend any of its legs. He suggested that extension in spider legs was hydraulic, not muscular or elastic. The idea was confirmed by Parry and Brown (1959), who measured resting pressures of 6.6 kilopascals and transient pressures of up to 60 kilopascals (over half an atmosphere) in spider legs. An isolated leg could lift more weight as the pressure inside it was increased, and the spiders turned out to have a special mechanism to seal off a joint that prevented fatal depressurization when a leg was lost.”"}, {"Source": "titan arum plant's spathe", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "protect from water", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bract-forms-waterproof-structure/", "Strategy": "Bract Forms Waterproof Structure\n\nThe spadix of the titan arum plant is protected from water by a specialized bract called a spathe, that clasps the spadix tightly enough to form a waterproof bag.\n\n“The tall grey spadix [of the titan arum], which is filled with cobweb-like support fibres, becomes flaccid, topples forward and droops over the margin of the spathe.

One grows into a tree up to thirty feet tall. Each of its branches ends in a dense rosette of large robust leaves. As the branches grow, so each year the lower ring of leaves in the rosette turn yellow and die. But they are not shed. Instead, they remain attached and form a thick lagging around the trunk. This is of crucial importance to the groundsel. The living leaves in the rosette contain special substances that prevent frost damage to the tissues and even though they may become covered by hoar frost during the night, they thaw out rapidly in the powerful warmth of the morning sun. But then the water within them starts to evaporate through their pores. If the liquid in the supply pipes running up through the trunk were to have frozen during the night, then the leaves would now be unable to replace their water and they would be baked dry and killed.

His call is a single-note pulse, and the louder it sounds, the farther it will reach, increasing the likelihood that a female will hear and respond to it.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nLike other frogs, the tree-hole frog uses vocal cords and a vocal sac to croak. Instead of expelling exhaled air like most other animals do when they make noise, frogs pass exhaling air across their vocal cords, then into their vocal sacs. The vocal sac itself is a natural sound amplifier, vibrating like the top of a kettle drum to transfer the sound of its call into the air.\n\nBut tree-hole frogs don’t simply rely on their own anatomy to amplify sound. They also use their watery holes as echo chambers. The frogs adjust the pitch of their calls until they find the resonant frequency of their surroundings.\n\nThe resonant frequency is the frequency at which a substance vibrates at its highest amplitude. For example, when the frequency of sound matches the resonant frequency of a wineglass, the glass vibrates so hard that it breaks.\n\nPipe organs form a particular note by forcing air through a pipe of a specific diameter and length, which causes the pipe to vibrate at its resonant frequency. If a tree-hole frog sat inside the pipe of a pipe organ and adjusted his pitch to match the pipe’s resonant frequency, the pipe would vibrate along with the frog’s vocal sac, boosting the sound volume. In a sense, a tree-hole frog plays a tree hole like a pipe organ.\n\nOne thing that affects the resonant frequency of a tree hole is the amount of water inside it. When scientists put a male tree-hole frog in a tube and slowly drained water from it, the frog continually tweaked his call to match the changing resonant frequency. Furthermore, when the frog found the resonant frequency, his croaks were longer in duration with fewer breaks in between, suggesting that when the amplifying effect is found, it’s worth the energetic cost to increase the chances of finding a mate.\n\nThe Potential\n\nLearning how tree-hole frogs use their surroundings to boost sound could lead to improved architectural designs that incorporate acoustics.

Suddenly, something the size of a small dog swoops by through the air. Is it a bird? A drone? No, it’s an Egyptian fruit bat, in search of overripe figs.\n\nLike other bats, this outsized flying mammal finds its food by clicking its tongue to produce sound waves and observing how they bounce back. At first it aims its clicks widely as it searches for a piece of fruit. Once the returning sound waves reveal food item, however, the search strategy changes. Rather than pointing the sound waves directly the object of its desire, the bat aims them slightly left and then slightly right of the target. Although this strategy seems counterintuitive, it improves the accuracy with which the bat can land on its favored food.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nSound waves travel in an expanding, cone-shaped path from their source. The best way for an animal using echolocation to find an object in the first place  is to point its clicks in lots of different directions. But these initial calls don’t provide much information about how the searcher and the searched are moving side to side relative to each other. As a result, such an approach has limited value in helping the animal fine-tune its position as it moves closer to its target.\n\nEnter the sound waves at the perimeter of the cone. If the bat aims its clicks to the side of the object, the sound waves that bounce back from the slanted part of the cone of sound contain more information about the relative movement between the searcher and the searched  than would those aimed directly at the object. By listening for the bounce back of sound waves at the edge of the cone where the difference in timing is larger, the bat can more easily tell if it’s getting “warmer” or “colder” from one click to the next and adjust its trajectory accordingly.\n\nThis is similar to the effect that we perceive when viewing an object in light that shines nearly parallel to a surface, as the sun does at dawn and dusk. In this “raking light,” shadows are greatly extended, making tiny objects and textures dramatically more noticeable. The bats are making use of “raking sound.” By angling their high-pitched sounds to either side of an object of interest, the echo comes back not as a bright, direct beam, but in steeply angled waves that exaggerate any relative change in position of the object, revealing more information to the bat with every click it makes.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe “sweet spot” the fruit bat has found between maximizing its odds of finding food and maximizing its odds of landing on it accurately is similar to strategies other animals likely use to follow sounds, scents, or other signals from a desired object. This suggests it is broadly beneficial as a “homing-in strategy.” Humans might apply a similar strategy to optimizing the search function for drones or other robots that use light, sound, or scent to track objects. The side-to-side switch-out also could be helpful for keeping aircraft on the straight and narrow during taxiing or flight or improving self-driving vehicles’ ability to stay in their lane with the fine-tuned finesse a skilled driver might use."}, {"Source": "water strider's body part", "Application": "devices that provide advanced warning of impending earthquakes or mudslides", "Function1": "sense minute, fast-moving waves", "Function2": "communicate", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/legs-detect-small-vibrations-for-communication/", "Strategy": "The Insect That Uses Waves to Communicate\n\nWater striders communicate with each other using body parts that send and sense slight vibrations in the water around them.\n\nIntroduction\n\nInsects of all kinds can use their six legs to walk on solid surfaces—but water striders have a special twist. The hairs on the feet of these long-legged bugs contain grooves that hold air bubbles, making it possible for them to walk on the surface of water without breaking through.\n\nBut that’s not their only claim to fame. These insects also have specialized structures on their legs and undersides that sense minute, fast-moving waves in the water around them. This ability allows water striders to communicate with each other by rapidly moving their legs up and down, vibrating the surface of the water in a way that other striders’ sense organs can detect.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nLike other insects, water striders have movement-sensing hairs called trichobothria on various parts of their bodies. But water striders have a special variation on the theme: They have several extra-long trichobothria sticking out of the ventral side of the end of their legs. These trichobothria just touch, but don’t pierce, the surface of the water – like a cat’s whiskers tickling the water in its bowl as it takes a drink.\n\nInsects also have a sensory organ called a chordotonal organ near their joints that lets them know when their joints move and can also sense other forces. Each is made up of structures called scolopidia. The scolopidia in turn are made up of three parts: a nerve cell that’s attached to the central nervous system and that includes a long, thin pressure-sensing extension called a dendrite; a scolopale cell, which serves as a sheath around the dendrite; and an attachment cell, which connects the rest of the scolopidium to the insect’s skin. Water striders have more scolopidia than other bugs, presumably making them super-sensitive to motion.\n\nWhen a neighbor rapidly moves its leg up and down, it makes tiny waves that travel across the surface. When these waves reach the legs of another strider, they cause them to activate these two sets of extra-sensitive sensory organs and alert the insect’s nervous system of the motion.\n\nTogether, the activated nerve cells translate the movement into information about the vibrations’ frequency and location of origin and so about the source that sent them. Humans are not water striders, so we’ll likely never be completely sure of what the messages are—but scientists have evidence that they include information about the sex of the sender and also provide warning signals if one strider is venturing too far into another’s personal space.\n\nThe Potential \n\nWater striders’ ability to sense minute vibrations with distinct meanings offers abundant inspiration for devices humans can use to detect movement and convey information. For instance, it might inspire the invention of devices that provide advanced warning of impending earthquakes or mudslides by catching small waves of movement traveling through the ground or air. It might serve as a model for enhancing structural engineers’ ability to test the resilience of buildings to vibrations caused by traffic or forces of nature. Or it might lead to the development of ways to communicate between humans, robotic devices, or both, that don’t rely on sight or the audible vibrations we call sound."}, {"Source": "hammerhead shark's eye", "Application": "human vision", "Function1": "maximize stereoscopic vision", "Function2": "maintain a wide field of view", "Function3": "triple the area of precision depth perception", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/shark-eyes-maximize-stereoscopic-vision/", "Strategy": "Shark Eyes Maximize Stereoscopic Vision\n\nHorizontal eye stalks allow eyes to rotate forward, creating a wider field of binocular vision.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCircumnavigating the island of New Zealand, undulating through the Gulf of California, and cruising along the Red Sea, hammerhead sharks are some of the ocean’s most widespread and spectacular creatures.\n\nTheir head shape is instantly recognizable, but the full range of functions it might serve remains something of a mystery. There are theories and evidence that it may make swimming easier, enhance the ability of smell, and improve detection of electric fields. Recent evidence reveals it also increases the size of this predator’s three-dimensional field-of-view.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nYou may have heard the phrase, “Eyes in front, I hunt. Eyes on the side, I hide,” which emphasizes the fact that most predators have their eyes facing forward, so that each eye’s visual field overlaps. The overlapping visual fields are assimilated by the brain to create a 3D sense of the world that can help predators accurately judge the distance to their prey for an accurate strike. By having their eyes on the sides of their head, prey species sacrifice stereoscopic vision but gain a nearly 360-degree visual field, useful for detecting potential predators approaching from any angle.\n\nAll sharks are predators, but in general, the shape of their heads and position of their eyes provide only a small (about 10-degree) stereoscopic visual field in front of them. The scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) triples that and sees stereoscopically across a sweep of 32 degrees. This is due to the fact that while hammerhead species’ eyes are on the sides of their “hammers”, they have moved into a slightly more forward-facing position over the generations as the hammer increased in width. This gives hammerheads the best of both worlds: maintaining a wide field of view while tripling their area of precision depth perception. This may help hammerheads to better track and capture the fast-moving fish species they prey upon.\n\nThe Potential\n\nHammerhead-style visual inputs could have many beneficial applications for humans. Medical technology is frequently challenged with detecting small objects (such as tumors) in contexts in which greater scale and three-dimensionality may reduce search time while increasing accuracy.\n\nHammerhead sharks may also have lessons for people who work to create large, three-dimensional experiences. Virtual reality (VR), originally inspired by human vision, is in a period of early growth and experimentation that could also look to other species’ visual systems to drive innovation. For example, VR feeds that mimic visual data from hammerhead-like eye positions could be used to give us the sense of having an expanded visual field, yet without completely sacrificing depth perception.\n\nOther potential applications include the placement of vehicle visual sensors, which need to maintain total environmental awareness (e.g., vehicles approaching from any side) while also identifying sudden, near-field hazards (e.g., a crossing deer)."}, {"Source": "australian blue butterfly's pupa", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "vibration", "Function2": "attract ants", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/fish-thrives-in-freshwater-and-seawater/", "Strategy": "Vibrations Attract Ants\n\nSalmon can spend part of their lives in freshwater and part in seawater due to adaptive changes in their physiology.\n\n“The pupa of the Australian blue butterfly (Jalmenus evagorus) uses vibration to attract ants, whose presence deters would-be predators.

This protection against damaging ultra-violet rays is more important for them than for the sandstone algae, for sunlight shines more strongly through snow than it does through quartz. During the summer, the sun is warm enough to cause a slight melting of the surface layers, and this provides the algae with the liquid water they need. Dust, brought by the wind, supplies the necessary minerals. The algae themselves manufacture a kind of anti-freeze which keeps the contents of their bodies liquid even when the temperature of the snow falls to several degrees below zero.

They could be ponderosa pines, but it’s hard to tell just by looking from the ground. What do you do? One option is to put sight behind you and smell their bark, in search of the tell-tale scent of vanilla or butterscotch.\n\nUntil recently, the human sense of smell was thought to be somewhat weak. Scientists had previously estimated humans could distinguish just 10,000 different smells. That may sound pretty good, but a 2014 study found that we can actually smell up to  1 trillion distinct odors. Humans often lean more heavily on our other senses—especially vision—to understand the world around us. But smell helps us recall memories, augments how we taste food, brings us joy (or disgust), and can alert us to danger.\n\nHow does the nose take in molecules from the air and tell our brains what we’re smelling?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nMost of the air we breathe through our nose isn’t smelled at all—it proceeds straight to the lungs and gives us the oxygen we need. On its way though, some of it passes over a small region in the top of the nasal cavity called the nasal epithelium.\n\nThe air around the ponderosa pines contains some molecules released by the trees’ bark. When we sniff it, some of those molecules are absorbed into a layer of mucus that coats the nasal epithelium. Air flow through the nasal cavity can actually impact the efficiency that molecules absorb into the mucus. The harder we sniff, the more molecules reach the mucus, and the stronger we sense an odor.\n\nThe mucus itself has several functions important to the sense of smell. For one, it protects the epithelium from drying out. It also contains proteins that bind with odor molecules. In part, these proteins help absorb hydrophobic molecules that would otherwise be repelled by the moist membrane. Mucus proteins also degrade molecules to clear the way for new scents to arrive. And these proteins transport molecules to special nerve cells called receptor cells, where the actual “smelling” begins.\n\nThere, the odor-causing molecules bind with the nerve cells, which directly connect to the olfactory bulb of the brain just above them. While we can register five types of taste (sweet, sour, salt, bitter, and umami), we have more than 100 million olfactory receptor cells that fall into about 400 types.\n\nScientists believe that each type of receptor cell is tuned to recognize certain molecules. Receptors of the same type “plug into” the same junction (called a glomerulus) in the olfactory bulb. Scientists think that each scent activates specific patterns of receptor cells, which then stimulate a unique combination of glomeruli—like how combinations of letters spell different words—to tell the brain what it’s smelling.\n\nMore recent science shows that the glomeruli don’t “spell” words based solely on the structures of  the original odor molecules. In 2010, researchers found that enzymes in the mucus convert some molecules into other forms before they bind with receptor cells. Specifically, they found that mucus enzymes change some odor-causing molecules that contain aldehydes and esters into acids and alcohols. As a result, smell signals sent to the brain represent a combination of the original and mucus-altered molecules.\n\nThe Potential\n\nWe already use detectors to identify airborne chemical dangers such as the presence of carbon monoxide and ammonia gases. However, often each technology is limited to “smelling” just one or a few molecules because they require a particular type of sensor. Mimicking the full array of scent detectors behind how we and other animals smell could lead to artificial intelligence that can sense thousands, or maybe millions, of smells.\n\nRefrigerators might be outfitted with sensors that identify food spoilage to prevent illness. Instead of training people and search dogs to find illegal drugs or explosives, detectors placed around airports could do the work. Ecological monitors could smell the pheromones of animal species to track their locations and migration patterns. Imagine how many lives could be saved if a hand-held device simply smelled cancer tumors?\n\nThere, the odor-causing molecules bind with the nerve cells, which directly connect to the olfactory bulb of the brain just above them.

Place a blueberry anywhere in your kitchen, and you will likely soon find the diminutive and intrepid fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) hovering nearby. Move the blueberry and turn on a rotating room fan, or try the experiment outside on a windy day. The fly will still find the treasure. How do these insects track odors to their source in a complicated and ever-changing environment?\n\nThe Strategy\n\nInsects like fruit flies initially determine the location of a food source using olfactory information. The plumes of odor that emanate from a food source do not typically flow out in a cartoonish stream. Air currents and turbulence break up the plume into smaller, more short-lived filaments. An insect then must infer the food source location amidst a background of many other unrelated smells.\n\nInsects follow a characteristic set of behaviors to help them use this sporadic olfactory information to locate a food source. Upon first detecting a filament of odor, they turn and move upwind, toward the source. When the odor filament ends, they begin moving laterally, across the direction of wind flow. Once they detect another filament, they move upwind again, homing in whiff by whiff. In this way, they use an accumulation of small experiences to build towards an ultimate determination of the food source.\n\nThe Potential\n\n Working with incomplete information is the norm in the real world. Creating computational programs that effectively model navigation by insects could have far-ranging applications in human technologies that aim to navigate in similarly-constrained situations.

Returning ants orient themselves to their nest entrance using both visual and scent-based landmarks. A desert ant knows it has found its way back home by remembering the scent around its nest entrance, with its two antennae acting as its homing device.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThis desert ant needs the extra help to find its way back to its nest after a foraging trip because it can travel more than 100 meters (328 feet) away from its nest in search of food. While visual landmarks may be useful in directing an ant back toward the general vicinity of its nest entrance, the entrance itself is inconspicuous without its scent marker.\n\nIn addition to visual landmarks, these ants use path integration, which is a mental map that tracks the direction and distance of the ant’s travels, and results in an estimate of the path the ant needs to take to get back to its starting point from its current location. This map can be thought of as a series of paths an ant knows to follow to find its way back home—even without any landmarks or points of reference—and they are constantly being updated while an ant is out foraging.\n\nPath integration is not always the fastest way to get home since it doesn’t involve exploring more efficient routes, but it is reliable.\n\nPerhaps even more fascinating than path integration is the map of smells the ants create and commit to memory. Odors are memorized according to whether they come from the left or the right of the ant throughout its previous return journeys from foraging. It has been experimentally proven that ants lacking use of one of their antennae are incapable of following their map of smells to return home. This means that the antennae are working together to pinpoint the source of a scent, much like how separate left- and right-channel speakers allow us to better determine the apparent source of a sound.\n\nThe Potential\n\nOlfactory detection could be useful in homing devices, such as those in self-driving vehicles or vehicles that are operated remotely and which might lose access to other navigational cues. Building the ability to create and remember olfactory maps into homing devices, in addition to their use of visual landmarks, would improve their effectiveness and efficiency in finding targets.\n\nPath integration offers a model for navigation.

While it relies on sight, smell, and sound, it also has senses that humans lack.\n\nSpecifically, sharks (and other animals) have special organs called ampullae of Lorenzini that allow them to sense electric fields that other animals emit.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nAll living organisms generate electric fields around their bodies. Movement—especially when muscle and nerve fibers ignite with action—creates some electric fields. Other fields result from charged ions produced as part of normal biological processes. Fish, for example, exude bioelectric fields at their mouths and gills because mucous linings in these areas directly contact the ocean and spill ions into the surrounding water. The salty seawater itself is laden with charged ions that help spread these fields out from the fish’s bodies.\n\nBut only some organisms can sense bioelectric fields. The Elasmobranchii, a subclass of fish which includes sharks, rays, and skates, is one group of animals that possesses this sense, called “electroreception.”\n\nSharks have noses to smell, eyes to see, and ears to hear similar to humans and other animals. We need those organs to convert sensory signals into nerve impulses that our brains can interpret. To detect electric fields, animals with electroreception have organs called “ampullae of Lorenzini,” named for the scientist who thought their bulbous structure resembled tiny flasks called ampules.\n\nExternal bioelectric fields cause negative electric charges to accumulate at the surfaces of special skin pores. Individual canals conduct the electric signal from each pore to an ampulla of Lorenzini, which contains sensing receptor cells. A glycoprotein gel that has conductive properties similar to that of seawater fills each canal and ampulla and works like an extension cord to electrically “connect” the pore’s surface to the receptor cells. Protons move through the gel, attracted by the external negative charge, and the receptor cells detect the accumulated charges.\n\nThe stronger the field, the more charge accumulates, and the harder the receptor cells stimulate their associated nerve fibers. In that way, the ampullae act like electrical transducers, converting the bioelectric field data into impulses  sent to the brain via a network of nerves that wrap around their outsides.\n\nJust as a sky-scraping antenna picks up more radio signals than a toothpick-sized version, biological differences affect the strength and sensitivity of a species’ electroreception. The quantity of pores and how they’re distributed on the body determine how well the brain integrates multiple signals into a complete “picture” of the external electric field. The number of pores can vary significantly; scientists found that a Port Jackson shark has fewer than 150 pores while a scalloped hammerhead has more than 3,000.\n\nThe location of pores also influences their function. Some stingrays have pores around their mouths and heads for sensing prey. Pores on their backs sense when another predator may be lurking above or behind.\n\nSimilar to tuning a radio to a particular station, electroreception can shift during different life stages to focus on particular signals.\n\nAcute sensing of predators benefits juveniles when they are young and vulnerable. When skates and bamboo sharks are embryos still developing inside eggs, they sense the biofields of nearby predators and stop their tail movements to reduce the chances that their own electric fields will give them away as potential snacks.\n\nLater in life, some species become more adept at sensing prey. When it’s time to mate, a surge in hormones appears to help male stingrays  turn into true love machines, becoming divining rods that detect breeding females.\n\nThe Potential\n\nInstead of casting nets that capture everything under the sea, imagine fishing boats that could emit electric fields to attract a specific species. Such “smart” fishing could help prevent overfishing of threatened and endangered species. Underwater robots could be outfitted with localized biofield emitters to deter marine life from mining or other industrial operations without overwhelming the area’s natural biofield signals. Perhaps electoreception devices could help people “see” the world in a new way. When we look beyond what humans currently perceive in the world, the possibilities of what we can learn are positively electrifying."}, {"Source": "male sea lamprey's gills", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "attract female sea lamprey", "Function2": "act as pheromone", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/pheromone-sends-long-range-signal/", "Strategy": "Pheromone Sends Long‑range Signal\n\nSpecial glands in male sea lamprey gills release a bile that acts as a sex pheromone to attract long-distance females.\n\n“We show that reproductively mature male sea lampreys release a bile acid that acts as a potent sex pheromone, inducing preference and searching behavior in ovulated female lampreys..the male of this fish species signals both its reproductive status and location to females by secreting a pheromone that can act over long distance.”"}, {"Source": "arabidopsis leaf", "Application": "light-triggered technology", "Function1": "perceive day length", "Function2": "trigger flowering", "Function3": "alter gene expression", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/leaves-transmit-signals-to-initiate-flowering/", "Strategy": "Leaves Transmit Signals to Initiate Flowering\n\nThe leaves of Arabidopsis protect the plant from blooming too soon by using light as an environmental cue to initiate a protein-signaling pathway that triggers flowering.\n\nPlants can perceive day length. This keeps them from flowering too early in the season–such as when pollinators are not as active or cold temperatures could freeze their reproductive parts. In order for flowering to occur, there must be communication between the leaf, where light is absorbed, and the shoot apex, where flowering occurs.\n\nPlants have evolved a signaling pathway that involves activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a protein whose expression is regulated by the gene, CONSTANS (CO). CO’s rhythm of expression is controlled by the circadian clock in which the amount of dark hours affect flowering. When days are longer and nights are shorter, the plant is exposed to more light and less darkness. CO expression rises and a product of FT moves to the areas of growth, activating flowering-time genes that enable flowering. Overall, this is a long-distance signaling pathway, triggered when light is detected, that alters gene expression to promote flowering. This mechanism has applications in light-triggered technology, such as heating and security systems in buildings. An important aspect of this mechanism and it’s application in technology is that flowering is not only dependent of day-length, but also on quality of light. Plants tend to flower more readily when exposed to far-red light, which is common in shady environments. Plants grown under far-red enriched light contain more CO mRNA, and thus flower more readily than plants grown under white light.\n"}, {"Source": "rock ant's behavior", "Application": "digital, distribution, and other networks", "Function1": "lead student ants to a food source", "Function2": "develop first-hand knowledge", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ants-teach-other-ants-how-to-find-food/", "Strategy": "Teachers Wait for Students to Get Bearings\n\nRunning together, teacher ants lead student ants to a food source, allowing them to wander and develop first-hand knowledge of the route. \n\nIntroduction\n\nGood teachers take their students by the hand and show them the way. Unless they’re ants. Then they take them by the antenna.\n\nScientists have shown that veteran and inexperienced rock ants (Temnothorax albipennis) maintain a tactile dialogue in which the former pass on their knowledge and the latter follow their lead. Despite their reputation as tiny, pre-programmed robots, ants actively teach and learn.\n\nThe Strategy\n\nThe lessons happen in the form of something called “tandem running.” Naïve ants that don’t know where to look for food seek ants that do. But they don’t merely follow the leader. They don’t run after them. The two—teacher and pupil—run together, keeping up a two-way conversation.\n\nThe experienced ants aren’t laying down a chemical trail for inexperienced ants to follow. And they aren’t just broadcasting knowledge that inexperienced ants may or may not seize and follow up on.\n\nThe “teacher” ants slow down to wait for the inexperienced ones. They pause, while the “student” ants often take big loops—likely to get the lay of the land and identify landmarks to guide their way the next time they seek food on their own. The “teacher” ants proceed only when their students tap their antennae on their teachers’ legs and abdomens to communicate that they are close by and ready to proceed with the lesson. The teacher-pupil pair move in tandem, slowing down when the distance between them grows large and speeding up again when they are only an antenna-length apart.\n\nThe behavior satisfies two definitions of teaching. First, it involves two-way dialogue between teacher and pupil. Second, the teacher changes its normal behavior—at a cost to itself—so that the student can learn more quickly.\n\nIn experiments, scientists showed that teacher ants can get to food sources four times faster if they aren’t burdened by students. The teacher pays this price in exchange for teaching others how to get food efficiently. The immediate cost to the individual pays off by increasing the fitness of the community as a whole.\n\nFurther experiments showed that, after their initial lesson with their teachers, student ants don’t repeat the same meandering path they may have taken during their lesson. They have learned about their surroundings and take speedy and direct routes from their nests to food sources.\n\nThe Potential \n\nTeaching and learning is much more complicated than just imitating a more experienced colleague. It’s a continual dialogue, in which teachers present information and then wait for students to contextualize and internalize it before proceeding.

Like many animals, the starling contains photoreceptors in the back of its eyes that allow it to see color, shape, and detail. Yet unlike most animals, the starling has a distinct composition of photoreceptor types that make it capable of seeing heightened levels of detail, and UV light.\n\nPhotoreceptors are cells in the back of the eye that convert ambient light into electrical impulses. The electrical impulses then travel to the brain where color, shape, and detail are registered. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods register general forms, and are optimized in darkness. They are more common in nocturnal species. Cones register color vision and fine detail, and are utilized in bright environments. They are more common in diurnal species.\n\nIn the starling, there are significantly more cones than rods making the starling better at seeing fine details. More significant, however, is that the types (or classes) of cones vary between the left and the right eye. This makes one eye more specialized for seeing the general features, and the other eye better seeing fine details.\n\nThere are two types of cones: single and double. Double cones are larger in size, and and absorb a wider range of wavelengths (light, in this case) than single cones. Single cones are divided into four classes that correspond to the maximum wavelength that can be absorbed. These are long wave sensitive (LWS), medium wave sensitive (MWS), short wave sensitive (SWS), and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS) cones.\n\nDouble cones are good at distinguishing between general shapes, but not good at distinguishing between individual colors and details. Single cones, on the other hand, absorb a smaller range of wavelengths but can distinguish more detail within the wavelengths they do absorb. For example, a double cone is like a box of markers with four colors (red, yellow, green, blue). You can draw an image, but there will not be a lot of detail. Now, if each color were in its own box of four varying hues (i.e., the red box contains maroon, burgundy, red, red-orange) the detail of the image would be far greater.\n\nWhat this creates is a specialized system of visualization. The right eye of the starling contains a greater amount of rods and double cones. These will be utilized for distinguishing movement, shape, and general color. The left eye contains more single cones that will be used to distinguish between complex hues, details, and UV frequencies.\n\n"}, {"Source": "woodlice", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "avoid dead and dying members of their own species", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/chemical-reception-discourages-taxis/", "Strategy": "Chemical Reception Discourages Taxis\n\nWoodlice reduce risk by avoiding dead and dying members of their own species via chemical signals they release.\n\nInsects and arthropods of various taxa avoid their dead and dying so as to prevent predation or the spread of disease.

The actinospore features a single-use filament ejection organ, which it uses to anchor itself to fish to implant new parasite cells. Since premature triggering of the filament capsule would mean death for the individual actinospore, they must respond to chemical cues originating specifically from fish.

The epidermal mucus coating of a salmon, a host species for Myxobolus cerebralis, is well adapted to supplement its swimming, ion/gas exchange, defense against physical damage, and immune system. M. cerebralis takes advantage of chemical compounds present in this mucus to signal that a fish host is nearby, triggering release of the parasite’s anchoring-filament. This adaptation is extremely effective in identifying a suitable fish host because the signaling compounds in the mucus are associated with critical metabolic processes, so the fish must produce them. They are also very water insoluble, so their detection by the parasite at certain concentrations indicate extreme proximity to host fish.

The diffusion and transmission efficiency of the shell is greater than a commercial diffuser reference material. Most strikingly, the shell, although opaque and pigmented, selectively diffuses the blue-green wavelength of the species bioluminescence.

Birds of prey are masters of sight. Bats and moths are known for their keen sense of hearing. For canines, the sense of smell rules. In the wild, an exquisite sense of smell gives wolves and others a leg up when it comes to finding prey and communicating with each other. In domestic dogs, it has become the foundation of an unexpected talent: the ability to help detect the presence of certain diseases and disorders in humans.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nDogs have a remarkable sense of smell. When they sniff, a bit of the air they take in goes to a maze-like structure in their heads called the olfactory recess. Thanks to the extensive surface area this structure offers, dogs have more than half a billion cells available to sense scent—some 15 times what humans have. The part of the nervous system these cells send signals to, called the olfactory bulb, is three times the size of that in humans. These adaptations allow a dog to respond to the presence of molecules in the air with exquisite sensitivity: Some dogs can detect a single odor molecule among a trillion others.\n\nThe Potential\n\nIf these chemicals are released in advance, they might also help anticipate the onset of an incident such as diabetic insulin imbalance or an epilieptic seizure. . Being able to know ahead of time that a seizure is coming on could be a literal lifesaver, allowing individuals to get out of the water, move away from hard objects, or otherwise enter a safe area before the seizure occurs.\n\nThe most direct approach to tapping this talent is using dogs directly as detectives. But that might not always be practical. Understanding the mechanism by which a dog’s olfactory system can pick out a single scent from among many others, even at extremely low concentrations, could open doors to the development of “e-noses” that electronically detect the presence of single molecules of interest in a sample.\n\nThis could lead to improved detection of illicit substances, the ability to provide evidence of the location of a person or movement of a person over time, and more. It also could inspire development of devices that use olfactory cues in place of visual or tactile elements—for example, a smart lock or smart ignition system that activates when a person with a unique scent profile shows up."}, {"Source": "dolphin's biosonar", "Application": "medical imaging", "Function1": "send ultrasonic sounds", "Function2": "determine the shape of the returning signals", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/biosonar-gives-an-accurate-imaging/", "Strategy": "Biosonar Gives an Accurate Imaging\n\nHigh resolution biosonar of dolphins, bats and mole rats gives an accurate imaging by using real-time data processing.\n\n“Biosonar animals send ultrasonic sounds called ‘pings’ into the environment.

When a minimum number of bacteria are in a certain area, they can suddenly change what they’re capable of doing, such as forming colonies with different physical abilities, producing different chemicals, and behaving in ways that can make them harder to get rid of. How do bacteria know when they have enough individuals to make the switch?\n\nBacteria use chemicals to communicate with each other. They can communicate about lots of things, including keeping track of the overall number of bacterial cells in a certain area. Bacteria pass ‘messages’ to each other by releasing different chemicals. Bacteria have sensors on the outside of their cells that allow them to pick up these chemical signals from other bacteria. When a lot of bacteria are in a certain area, there are lots of signals being picked up by the sensor. When the communication chemicals reach a certain threshold, this triggers to the other bacteria that there are enough of them to make the switch to start behaving as a colony.\n\nHaving systems for knowing when conditions are right to take action is something bacteria have mastered, and it’s a skill people often could use as well. Timing a policy change, introducing a new idea at a meeting, or altering one’s own behavior can perhaps all be done better by attending to cues around us.\n"}, {"Source": "talpid's snout", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "detect pressure", "Function2": "detect objects and prey", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/snout-detects-pressure/", "Strategy": "Snout Detects Pressure\n\nThe snout of talpids can detect pressure and other sensory input thanks to the Eimer's gland, a mechanosensory organ.\n\n“Talpids also possess an Eimer’s gland, a mechanosensory organ present on the rhinarium.

These alligators live in swamps, rivers, and lakes of the southeastern United States. Even with a scaly and tough-looking exterior, parts of the alligator’s body are highly sensitive to touch—even more sensitive than a human’s fingertips. This is achieved with an array of sensory organs in the alligator’s scales.\n\nThe touch-sensitive organs are called integumentary sensory organs. On the surface of a scale, the sensory organs appear as small, dark dome-shaped spots typically ~0.5 mm in diameter. Thousands of these sensory organs cover the alligator’s face. They are especially dense around the teeth, inside the mouth, and at the tip of the snout.\n\nUnder each dome lies a dense network of touch-sensitive receptor cells (known as mechanoreceptors) and nerves. When part of the dome is pushed down by an object the alligator encounters or even moving water, this stimulates the touch-sensitive receptor cells. The cells are sensitive to deflections as small as 4 μm, just a fraction of the width of a human hair. The stimulated receptor cells then send signals along connected nerve cells to the central nervous system, which includes the alligator’s brain. There are a variety of receptor cells and nerves in each dome-shaped organ: some respond to continuous stimulation (like a constant push) while others are more sensitive to changing stimuli (like vibrations).\n\nResearchers hypothesize that these extremely touch-sensitive areas around the mouth help the alligator locate, capture, and examine prey even when visual and sound cues are absent. The alligator will open its mouth slightly while searching for food in the water, using its integumentary sensory organs to detect disturbances in the water from a moving object. Once the alligator finds and bites the object, it can examine the object with its mouth to see if it’s edible."}, {"Source": "honeybee's abdomen", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "decrease drag", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/raised-abdomen-reduces-drag/", "Strategy": "Raised Abdomen Reduces Drag\n\nAbdomen of honey reduces drag during flight by being raised to increase streamlining.\n\n“Our results have revealed, for the first time, the existence of a visually driven streamlining response in flying insects.

This diversity gives researchers the possibility of examining how distinct groups compare in terms of tool use and the teaching behavior that passes it down to each generation.\n\nVisiting one population in the Republic of Congo, you’d see that chimpanzees use a large set of complex tools to aid in a variety of tasks, such as fishing for termites. Using gestures and vocalizations, juveniles in this group request to use the tools of adults much more often than juveniles in groups with a simpler toolkit, and their requests are granted more often. Also, when juveniles of this population struggle in using tools, adults take the initiative to hand over their own tools for the juveniles to use.\n\nAcross the continent, a chimpanzee population in Tanzania uses a much simpler tool set for fishing termites. When researchers observed this group, juvenile’s requests to use adult tools were usually denied. And when juveniles struggled in using tools, adults didn’t take the initiative to provide their own tools for juveniles to use.\n\nThe Potential\n\n These patterns suggest that chimpanzee communities can maintain more complex tool use patterns when the teaching effort or teaching willingness is relatively high. Investments in this kind of education appear to be part of what allows complex tool use to persist, and perhaps to come about in the first place.

The shape of the opening is generally ellipse and sometimes almost circular. Deformation in the insect’s cuticular layer is sensed by the campaniform sensillum using mechanical coupling, transduction and an encoding mechanism to transfer the environmental information to the insect’s nervous system. Previous work by one of the authors (JFVV) showed that the mechanical coupling mechanism was resolved into discrete components: a cap surrounded by a collar, a joint membrane and an annulus-shaped socket septum with a spongy compliant zone (the spongy cuticle). The coupling mechanism is a mechanical linkage which transforms the stimulus into two deformations in different directions: monoaxial transverse compression of the dendritic tip of a sensory neuron cell, which acts as a transducer, and vertical displacement of the cap. The natural campaniform sensilla, regardless of the high Young modulus of the exocuticle layer of the insect (k ≈ 109 Nm−2), can still detect changes. These sensors are as sensitive to displacement in that stiff structure as the receptors in the human ear are to sound [8].

That makes the month during which a zebra finch learns to sing the song demonstrated by its father the most important month of its life. With such high stakes, finding the perfect tutor is essential. As it turns out, the finch’s own brain might be the best teacher of all. Scientists have found that one part of the brain, deemed the “tutor,” teaches another part of the brain, the “student,” in a coordinated effort to improve performance of the finch’s song.\n\nBirds, like musicians, hone their songs through practice. Zebra finches sing, compare what they hear to a memory of the song, and adjust the parts that are not quite right. The student part of the brain changes its control on the respiratory muscles used to sing to make adjustments to the song. However, it is the tutor part of the brain that decides what these changes should be.\n\nMuch like in humans, each brain region has its own learning style. The criteria that help a region learn best follow a set of rules that facilitate communication between neurons. These rules are vital for learning, and different parts of the brain have different rules. If the tutor region sends information to a student region based on the wrong set of criteria, the performance will be dreadful. It would be like trying to teach in French to a class that only understands Russian.\n\nIn this circuit, however, it is not only the student that learns. The teaching signal must balance its lessons on multiple levels. Sometimes, it is best to correct an erroneous sound immediately. Other times, a broader correction on the song as a whole is more helpful. The tutor part of the brain receives feedback about how well it is teaching and adapts accordingly. Simply put, while the tutor is helping the student learn to sing, the tutor is also learning how to be a more effective instructor. Given the rules that the student region needs to succeed, the teaching signal adapts within those constraints to improve the zebra finch’s song.\n\nWhat works in a zebra finch’s brain can also lead to success in the human classroom.

Large eyes and pupils, highly light-sensitive cells (photoreceptors), and a short focal length (the distance from the center of the eye’s lens to the point where light converges) make not only viewing and then capturing prey possible at night, but also help geckos to see in color in low-light conditions.\n\nThese same nighttime visual adaptations pose a problem during the day because they would normally lead to a defocusing of the image and blurring of colors. The combination of a large pupil and short focal length creates an optics problem where the eye bends some wavelengths (or colors) of light more than others. Nocturnal geckos, however, appear to have strategies to counteract this. First, their eyes have multifocal lenses. This means that different parts of the lens each focus a different range of wavelengths onto the eye’s light-sensitive cells. The result is increased focus for all the colors of light the eye can perceive. Second, when a nocturnal gecko’s pupil is fully constricted in high-light conditions, it forms two sets of pinholes along a vertical slit. Scientists hypothesize that when the pupil is fully constricted the four small stacked pupils that form reduce the total amount of light entering the eye, while still enabling the different parts of the multifocal lens to receive light.\n\nThe unique nocturnal gecko eye might have two additional functions alongside preventing visual disturbances during the day. The multiple pupils generate several images on the retina with varying levels of focus, which the gecko can interpret to judge distance. The iris is also a similar color to the gecko’s scales, and so the thin slit with pinholes may facilitate daytime vision while increasing the nocturnal gecko’s ability to blend into its environment."}, {"Source": "platypus's bill skin", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "detect tactile stimulation", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/bill-skin-detects-touch/", "Strategy": "Bill Skin Detects Touch\n\nThe bill skin of the platypus and echidna detects tactile stimulation via the push-rod, thought to be a type of mechanoreceptor.\n\n“The other prominent receptor in the bill skin of both the platypus and echidna is the ‘pushrod,’ which is thought to be a mechanoreceptor responding to tactile stimulation.” "}, {"Source": "bees' eyes", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "detect color, detect polarized light", "Function2": "navigate", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/eyes-help-navigate-using-the-sun/", "Strategy": "Eyes Help Navigate Using the Sun\n\nThe eyes of bees help them navigate by detecting polarized light.\n\n“Bees have an amazing ability to discern and employ polarized light.

Under the hard, transparent armor of the beetle is an intricate multilayer filled with a pattern of grooves. The layers become thicker farther down the layered column (a structure referred to as a “chirped” multilayer).\n\nMoisture causes humidity to fill these grooves.

Swarms of bacteria figure it out all the time without even a glance at a smartphone or other navigational aid. Their secret? An elaborate form of guess-and-check informed by feedback from neighbors that are making smart or not-so-smart choices themselves—combined with unusual adaptability in whether they follow the crowd or their own instincts.\n\nThe Strategy \n\nMany birds, fish, and other animals travel in flocks or swarms, in which large groups of individuals gather information from each other and the environment allowing them to travel as a unified group rather than as individuals headed every which way. Often this works in their favor, leading them to food, providing protection from predators, or allowing them to minimize the energy expended in moving from one place to another. But if an individual misinterprets signals from the environment as to which direction is more favorable, it not only leads itself away from the optimal path, it can take others with it as well.\n\nWhen more sophisticated organisms such as birds and fish move in groups, they use their brains to process large amounts of information related to the position of those around them and integrate that into the decision about how to move. Bacteria seem to be able to get around the problem of misinterpreting signals by following simpler rules than more complex organisms do regarding how to alter their direction based on signals from the environment and each other. Rather than always interpreting those signals similarly, they alter their responses based on whether the concentration of a chemical that attracts them is increasing in the direction they are currently moving. If it isn’t, they pay attention to the direction of the movement of other bacteria around them. But if  it is indeed toward a more favorable setting, they pay less attention to their neighbors and follow their own instincts instead. Computer modeling has shown that this ability to alter “rules of movement” depending on the circumstances ultimately leads to a more beneficial outcome for the entire group of organisms—with a less complex algorithm to follow.\n\nThe Potential\n\nThe ability to use simple rules to efficiently find favorable conditions has boundless applications. It already is being used to help give robots protocols for movement that allow them to take into consideration environmental conditions as well as preprogrammed instructions for achieving a goal. And, although applications are most obvious related to physical movement, it’s possible that the sets of rules could be applied to other types of robotic “decisions” as well, such as when to deploy different kinds of tools and how to react to changes in weather, presence of living organisms, or other variable factors in the environment. In addition, the strategies bacteria use could be applied to improving project management, workflows, and other activities that involve multiple steps and benefit from course correcting using information gathered along the way.\n\n\n"}, {"Source": "mammals' external ear‑flaps", "Application": "not found", "Function1": "aid hearing", "Function2": "collect and concentrate sound waves", "Hyperlink": "https://asknature.org/strategy/ear-flaps-concentrate-sound-waves/", "Strategy": "Ear‑flaps Concentrate Sound Waves\n\nThe external ear-flaps of many mammals aid hearing by collecting and concentrating sound waves.\n\n“It is only among mammals that ears become noticeable, even striking, because of the visible external ear-flaps behind the narrow opening of the outer ear tube…The most obvious use of the ear-flap, though not necessarily the most important, is to gather and concentrate sound waves.”"}]
